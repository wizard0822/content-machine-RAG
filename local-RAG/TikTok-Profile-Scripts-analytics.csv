to learn math from celebrities.
This is insane.
Yo, can you explain?
Looks alright,
let's do it.
I've always used BAP
to remember how it works.
Mention what it stands for. Shawty.
It stands for base,
answer and then power.
What do you use that for?
So look, this number is our base
and it should turn into this answer here
when it has a certain power.
And that power,
that's what we're actually finding here.
So like this whole love thing is equal to that power.
Correct? Mundo.
So what this really means is
how many twos do you have to times together to make 16?
You can just type it into your calculator
and it'll get the result for you. I got four.
That is correct.
So two, which is our base to the power of 4 = 16. Finally,
we're seeing deep fake technologies be used for good.

chat dev, build an AI workforce.
This is the biggest jump in AI I've seen this year.
Auto GPT was created and everyone lost their mind.
But an application,
it kind of sucked and didn't ever complete tasks.
Now we have chat dev,
which is similar but significantly more powerful.
You basically set up a whole company with AI.
Every department.
When you give it tasks,
it will go through each department, CEO,
chief product officer,
programmer, reviewer, tester.
The best part,
it works and it's free.
Give it an idea,
it will create the idea,
test it, and even provide documentation.
But it can also be customized,
edit the agents and departments
and turn it into a marketing agency.
These cases are insane.
This is the future of AI.
After the project is done,
you can even use the web interface to see
how it did the tasks.
And it's brilliant.
You can download it free from the chat dev get hub.

No. 1 we have Leonardo AI.
You get 150 credits per day
and this is the second best image generator
in my opinion.
No.2 we have Blue Willow.
You can use Blue Willow version 3 for free
and version 4 is very low cost.
It's a great generator.
No. 3 we have Playground AI.
They let you create 1,000 images per day
and you get commercial rights.
Definitely try this one out.
No. 4 Desco. It's free.
You can pay for faster processing,
but the image generation is free
and it generates amazing images.
No. 5 dreamlike art.
24 free credits per day

and it may be the best AI image generator I have ever tested.
And it's free. Let me show you.
First, testing with my typical prompt.
A man in a space suit floating with a galaxy background.
Bam. Looks good.
I wouldn't say it's as creative as the other models,
but wait until you see the next tests.
Prompt adherence. Testing how well it can follow a prompt.
A bear standing on a chair holding a duck.
This was the first image generator to succeed on every single image.
It has unreal prompt adherence.
We're going to need to upgrade this test soon.
Next, text.
It had no problems generating text.
It wasn't perfect. It had some airs generating complex text,
but overall has no issues.
Very long text did have some issues,
but it could be fixed with prompt hacking.
And realism. A realistic man doing a Ted talk.
The images look like a photograph.
It may even be better than flux.
10 out of 10 on realism. A couple notes.
It has some weird censorship.
It wouldn't let me generate an image with text using my full name.
I find this model is very capable,
but for creative and artistic generations,
you do need a good prompt.
Overall though, it's free.
It's one of the best generators I've ever tested.

it looks incredible.
Not only is it a new large language model from X AI,
they've also added an image generator.
Looking at performance in the benchmarks,
the mini model has impressive scores

with the best large language models available.
An early version of GROK 2 has been tested on LM
SIS leaderboard under the name sus
column R. At the time of this release,
it is out performing both Claude 3.5 sonnet and G P t 4 Turbo Crazy.
I tested it with the question that breaks
majority of large language models.
How many RS are in strawberry and it absolutely nailed it
even providing the logic first try.
Rock 2 Mini also comes with a new design that looks great
for image generation. They're using flux 1 from Black Forest Labs,
which is huge.
Flux is the new AI image generator everyone is talking about
that does hyper realistic images,
almost perfect text and outstanding prompt adherents.

Just hit the lightning bolt beside the content
you want to represent with an image
and Bam, it has a ton of sparks to choose from.
Select the style
and you can further refine to get exactly what you want.
It'll even generate icons for your titles.
After you generate the images,
you can edit any part, add more elements,
change the text, change the colors,
anything. To download the image,
just hit the purple download button,
select from PNG, SVG or PDF.
You can also find Sparks with a search at the bottom

web search for querying the web URL
fetcher to fetch text content from websites,
a document parcer that supports Pdfs,
text, PSV,
JSON and more. A full image generator,
also completely free image editing
which will edit images based on a given prompt
and a calculator tool
which significantly increases large language models
ability to complete math problems.
On top of that, they've just released assistance
and they already have thousands of them
including coding assistant,
web designers, pretty much everything all for the price of free.

L m can output from a request.
We have seen very little advancements in this since G b t 3.5 turbo

To compare this to other models
quad 3.5 Sunnet has 4,096 but they have a beta that outputs 8,192.
Lama 3.1 has 4,096 output tokens.

64K is a massive jump and opens up a ton of long output applications.

outputs in the background

Mistral dropped a new large language model called large 2.
This is the second generation of Mistral's flagship model.
They claim massive improvements in code,
math logic, multi language support and function calling.
It has only 123 billion parameters compared to Lama three point ones
405 billion, so almost one quarter of the size.
How does it compare in the main large language model benchmark,
which is quite honestly a trash way of evaluating models at this point?
It scored 84%, slightly under llama three point ones,
88.6% coding. Looking at the humanaval benchmark,
it takes the win,
even scoring close to GPT 4 o and outscoring Claude 3.5 sonnet.
They also claim its tool use in function calling
outscores every other LLM.
The context length is 128 k.
It supports over 80 programming languages and dozens of languages.
If you want to try it, you can use it on Mistrose Le Chat at this URL
or if you have enough memory,
you can download the model and waits from hugging face.
But it comes with no commercial rights.

with information from the web
to give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources.
So basically
they're making a perplexity style AI that answers your search query,
gives you the references and where they got the data.
Then you're able to ask follow up questions.
Interesting to see all these companies going after AI.

It's not GPT5, it's a GPT 3.5 killer.
The new model is called GPT 4 0 Mini and this is actually huge news.
The model is very smart. It scores 82 on the m m L
U benchmark versus G P t 4 OS 88.7 score and a massive jump over G P
t 3.5 Turbos 70 score.
Not only is this model a lot smarter than G P t 3.5,
it's a fraction of the cost.
It's priced at ?15 per million input tokens
and ?60 per million output tokens
in order of magnitude more affordable than previous frontier models
and more than 60% cheaper than GPT 3.5 Turbo.
It supports 128 k context and it has 16 k output tokens.
Impressive numbers. I tested the speed and it's extremely fast.
I was getting over 150 tokens per second on output.
So to sum it up, this model is very smart and capable,
extremely low cost and fast.
The applications are endless.
Perfect for agents classification of data.
A ton of tasks
previously couldn't be done with AI due to cost constraints,
but this completely changes everything.
It's already available to try on chat GBT and using Open AI's API.
So I would check it out.
I find it's just as capable as 4 o on majority of tasks

Meta hasn't even launched this large language model yet.
I was making a business course on how to automate 90% of your work
so you can just sit on a beach all day.
I went to the GPT 4 o page scroll down a bit and what the fuck,
they already have the performance numbers for Llama 3 4 hundred b
and it looks impressive. Check this out for m m L U
the main test that large language models are benchmarked with
it has an impressive 86.1 score vers G P t 4 o 88.7.
I think this is real
considering the current llama 3 70 b instruct model scored only 82
on the other tests like math and human eval
it's very close to G P t 4 o
and pretty much on par with all foundation models available.
According to rumors,
Meta's 400B model will be released sometime this month.
It will come with the ability to process both text and images.
It also will be completely open source and come with the weights

you can do adjustments to the design on the fly without starting over.
This is huge for developers

Here are the results. Bam.
Really impressive. You get three design options to choose from.
The design works in web, tablet and mobile. Insane.

Not bad at all. Here are some other generations I made.
It seems to do good with drone style footage,
anything zooming in, zooming out,
moving scenes. I'm really impressed with the quality.
Prompt adherence is decent.
It follows the prompt, but you don't always get what you want.
Text generation. I keep seeing reviews where they could generate text.
The model did not wanna generate any text for me.
Sometimes even using random words and text not in the prompt.
Now let's test AI video generator.
Kryptonite AI gymnastics. Yep,
it's still not that good yet.
How do I rate this generator?
It is the best text to video generator I have tried.
I wouldn't say it's close to sore level and still needs a lot of work,
but they've made some massive improvements.
We need to let this tech cook for another 6 months.
How much is it?
They have zero free generations and it's a bit expensive
around $15 for 10 5 second generations.
But if you wanna make a lot of videos,
they have an unlimited plan for $76 per month,

Cognify, the prison of the future.
This new prison concept
proposes bombarding criminals with artificial memories
from the perspective of their victims.
What could go wrong? You have to see this video.
Instead of spending years in an actual prison cell,
prisoners could finish their sentence here in just a few minutes.
Cognify could someday create and implant artificial memories
directly into the prisoner's brain.
These complex,
vivid and lifelike memories are created in real time using AI
generated content.
Depending on the seriousness of the subject's crime and their sentence,
the memories could be tailored to the rehabilitation
needs of each subject.
The artificial memories implanted by cognify
would be seamlessly
incorporated into the existing neural networks of the brain.
Inside the criminal's mind,
time would pass differently,
slower than in real life,
making them experience years worth of artificial memories
in just a few minutes. Synthetic memories are customized
depending on the crime committed
and the unique brain structure
and psychological profile of the individual.
Violent offenders
could experience memories that are designed to trigger empathy
and remorse, seeing their crime from the perspective of their victim.
I am pretty sure this is a brainwashing device.

We may be the first generation that can live forever.
Some are predicting we'll reach this point by 2030.
Check out this recent interview with Ray Kurzweil
backing his calls with dozens of graphs and voluminous research,
including the claim that by the early 2030s,
we will reach something called longevity escape velocity,
which is as time goes by, the,
the risk of your dying will not go up.
So we won't actually succumb to aging.
Does that mean we live forever?
It's not forever. I mean,
you could take a 20 year old who has nothing wrong with him
and you could compute his longevity as being many,
many decades and he could die tomorrow, right?
So an accident? Yeah.
You could also get a disease we haven't cured yet.
It's, it's not a guarantee.
It just means that we won't increase our chance of dying
as time goes by. What,
what age do you think you'll live to?
And what, what age do you wanna live to?
Uh, why would I ever wanna die?
I mean,
people only choose to die if they're in insufferable pain or physical,
psychological, spiritual.
But if they're, uh,
of right mind, people wanna live.
So there's no reason I would get to a point say,
well, I don't want to live anymore.
So I'd like to live forever.
But that's a goal. Okay.
Maybe I should ease up on the popcorn.
I just have to. Make it to 2030,

Stick around to the end and I'll show you how to install it.
All you need is an audio clip and an image of a person

I recorded a clip of myself talking and use this image as the Avatar.
Hit generate. Alright,
let's test. Hollow. Help.
I'm stuck in an AI Avatar.
Somebody send help. Bam.
Not that bad.
I wouldn't say it's as good as Headra but it's free and open source.
It works well for dialogue and even making music videos.
Installing it is easy. I recommend using Pinocchio.
Go to the Pinocchio website,
download and install the app.
Go to the discover page, click hollow,
then download. When it's done,
click install and click start to start running it.
Easy, easy.
A couple of notes. I have a 40,
90 and the processing time took a while.
It also requires an Nvidia GPU.
You don't have an Nvidia GPU.
You can run it directly from hugging face spaces or
it also has a comfy UI integration.

Claude 3.5 Sonic and it's now available to use free on Claude Dot AI.
3.5 Sonic beats everything in almost every landmark
quad 3 Opus, GBT 4 o smashes all of it.
Also massive improvements in the vision model.
Again, beating everything.
It is significantly faster,
2 x the speed of quad 3 Opus and it's a smarter model.
They also released a game changing feature called artifacts.
When you ask to generate code,
text documents or website designs,
the results appear in a window beside the chat.
This creates a dynamic workspace where you can see,
edit and build upon Claude's creations in real time.
It basically changes it from a conversational AI
to a collaborate of workspace. Huge.
It supports up to 200 k context length,
which is higher than GBT4 O's 128 k.
Token cost are only $3 per million input tokens
and $15 per million output tokens.
How does that compare to GBT 4 o?
Slightly less.
The same cost for output token and $3 versus $5 on input tokens.
In my opinion, it's really good.
Plot has always been a better writer than G P t
but now it's starting to become better in more areas like vision,
coding and reasoning.

I've tested every public AI video generator in existence.
Here are the best. Dream Machine,
one of the latest AI video generators,
supports image to video and text to video generations.
It comes with 33 generations,
but the pricing is quite high.
In my opinion, this is the best generator on the market right now.
Pika, this generator has been one of the best for a while.
They just released a new image to video model
that has impressive generations.
Not always the best output,
but if you learn how to use it,
it can make some gems.
They have a free tier so you can try it out today at Pika dot art.
Leonardo Motion lets you add motion to generated images.
It's a bit limited. You can't give it any prompt guidance,
but the results are quite good.
Kling, straight out of China.
This new video generator looks amazing.
It is even available to try,
but requires a Chinese phone number.
I haven't got access to it yet,
but lots of others have. So it's definitely not vaporware.
And lastly, Sora,
by far the best generator,
but we will not likely get access for a while.
Open AI is holding back and only releasing to studios,
likely because they're tired of lawsuits.
Will it release this year?

Leonardo AI just launched their own image model called Phoenix
and you can try it Today.
Phoenix is the first foundational model that they have created.
It features impressive text generation and better prompted hearings.
Let's try it out. Testing my typical prompt,
a man in a space suit floating with a galaxy background.
Bam, not bad.
Now let's test its ability to generate text.
Starting with simple text,
a robot holding a sign that says help me easy.
Now a bit more complex,
a neon sign that says Bat Farmer AI in front of a futuristic neon city.
Bam, nailed it with majority of generations.
It was also able to incorporate text in the reflection.
Alright, let's give it a hard text generation.
A sign that says like and subscribe to Matt Farmer AI.
Most generators fail. This one 3 out of 4.
This may be the best text generator.
Now prompt adherents using my typical prompt,
a bear on a chair holding a duck.
The output was a lot more artistic than most,
but it wasn't able to nail the prompt overall from testing,
it is quite good at prompted here.
And so Leonardo has a free tier that comes with 150 credits per day
and has paid plans starting at $12 per month.
Go test it out. Let me know what you think of the comments.

but no 7B models perform that well.
But the 72B version is very powerful and quite fast.
Not quite at G P t 4 level,
but these open models are getting very close.
If you wanna try it out, they're hosting a free demo on Hugging Face.
You can use it at this URL.

Yeah, me either.
We just had a video drop from Brain Bridge
announcing the head transplant system that is allegedly safer,
faster and reliable compared to what?
I'm not sure. And it's also using AI. Watch this.
Introducing Brain Bridge,
the world's first revolutionary concept for a head transplant machine,
which uses state of the art robotics
and artificial intelligence
to conduct complete head and face transplantation procedures,
ensuring smooth outcomes and faster recoveries.
Because head transplants require high speed,
precision and efficiency, Brain Bridge utilizes advanced high speed,
high precision robotic systems to speed up the process,
eliminate human error,
prevent brain cell degradation and ensure seamless compatibility.
The head transplant procedure involves removing a person's entire head
containing the brain from their current diseased body
and attaching it to the body of a healthy
young brain dead donor. Head transplants could provide individuals
with severe medical conditions
such as terminal cancer, paralysis,
spinal cord injuries or neurodegenerative diseases,
the opportunity to have a fully functional body
while preserving their consciousness,
memories and cognitive abilities.
The neurons are the longest lasting functional cells in the human body.
And according to our estimates,

and the features are insane.
Check out this demo of Co pilot plus helping a user play Minecraft.
Hey, Co pilot,
how's it going?
Hey, I'm doing great.
And it looks like you're about to dive into some Minecraft.
Ready to build, explore and maybe dodge a few mobs.
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to make a sword.
My son plays this game all the time and I have no idea what I'm doing.
No worries, I'm here to help you impress your son.
I see you've got a crafting table in front of you,
which is a great start to craft a sword.
You'll need some materials.
Can you open your inventory?
Just press e on your keyboard.
Yeah. Do I have what I need?
Let's see. You got some sticks.
Perfect for the sword's handle,
but it looks like you're missing the material for the blade.
You can use wood, stone,
iron, gold or diamond.
Let's start by gathering some wood or stone,
shall we? Head out and find some resources.
Yeah, that sounds great.
Oh my god. What's that?
Oh no, it's a zombie run.
You need to get away from it fast.
Either sprint away or quickly
build a tower of blocks straight up to get out of its reach.
If you can find a shelter or dig into the side of a hill,
do it now. Just make sure it Can't reach you. Alright,
I think I might be safe now. Cool.
That was a close one. Great job finding shelter.
It comes with a new type of processor called neuroprocessing unit NPU.
It is produced by arm and runs at 40 trillion operations per second
while pilot plus PCs also have other new features like recall
where you can find anything you have ever seen or done on your PC.
Co creator basically a generative AI version of Ms Paint.
Also live captions and translations natively in Windows
translating both voice and text directly on your PC.

Let me show you. I used a prompt about a man floating in space,
finds a dog floating in space,
they explore and become friends.
Hit generate and it will create the script, characters,
video, everything and entire story.
The first screen gives you the option to edit the characters.
It will even keep these characters consistent throughout the video.
There is an option to face swap the characters.
Needless to say, I did that with myself.
It also has options to select the style,
aspect ratio. Let's go to the next step.
Here you can edit the individual scenes of the video,
change the prompts they used.
You can edit every single aspect of the video.
When you are done, simply export.
Here is the video. As I floated alone in the vastness of space,
a glint of fur caught my eye.
That's when I met Cosmo, a golden retriever in a space suit.
Together, we ventured into uncharted galaxies,
witnessing cosmic wonders that few have ever seen.
Through it all, our bond grew stronger,
transcending the barriers of our worlds.
In the endless expanse of the cosmos,
we found companionship that knows no bounds.
This was created with almost zero changes.

Google just announced Veo,
a new generative video model and it looks insane.
It generates high quality
1080 p resolution videos that could go beyond a minute
in a wide range of cinematic and visual styles.
It supports mask to editing,
enabling changes to specific areas of the video
when you add a mask area to your video
and text prompt.
Also image to video generation and controls for filmmaking.
When given both an input video and editing command,
like adding kayaks to an aerial shot of a coastline,
Bo can apply this command to the initial video and create a new
edited video.
Maintaining visual consistency can be a challenge for video generation
models. Characters,
objects or even entire scenes can flicker,
jump or morph unexpectedly,
disrupting the viewing experience.
Bo's cutting edge latent effusion transformers
reduce the appearance of these inconsistencies,
keeping characters,
objects and styles in place as they would in real life.
Wow. They also mentioned in the future
will bring some of Veo's capabilities to YouTube

They will change how you analyze and organize your data.
Let's try it out. First,
convert to table. This feature automatically formats your tables
and gives you the ability to easily add functionality
like drop downs. I have a checklist for a new client.
Select the data, go to format and select convert to table.
Wow, that was easy.
I probably just saved 10 minutes.
Next, tables where you can use pre built tables.
Click on one of the options on the sidebar.
Let's select event budget.
Bam, a beautiful functional table automatically created with AI.
They even added relevant data to the table and formatted it.

A realistic raccoon, not bad.
One of them is wearing clothes,
but overall a pass. Okay,
let's test prompt adherents.
A bear standing on a chair holding a duck.
It actually did better than most generators on this one.
Not perfect. Most were a fail,
but it got very close. At least 1 in 4 generations were correct.
It can also do some basic text,
but it has issues with advanced text.
Only a few image generators have that capability.
On the side, it has options to select style,
creativity level, detail level and aspect ratio.
You get 100 images per day,
which is plenty.
It does have plans starting at $12 per month that include 2 x UPS,
scaling, priority generation,
and 36,000 images per month.
I would try it out. It's a great free generator.

3 is considered to be competitive with other flagship
generative AI models like Gemini Pro 1.5 and Claude 3 sonnet.
Very impressive.
It was trained on a large dataset of 15 trillion tokens.
It comes with 8K context which will likely be increasing
along with adding multi modality and a 400 billion parameter version.
It is also open source. You wanna try it out.
It is actually available on Messenger, WhatsApp,
Instagram and Facebook. Meta also launched Meta Dot AI.
We can try it for free in a chat GBT style interface
which includes giving the model access to the web

We can finally try stable diffusion 3.
Let's test it out. First,
looking at the creativity
I used to prompt
a man in a space suit floating with a galaxy background.
Bam! Very detailed and looks good.
Next test is one of the most important prompt adherents,
a bear standing on a chair holding a duck.
It passed 1 out of 3 attempts,
not bad. And the images were very creative.
Most image generators have issues with this prompt.
Alright, now let's do a test on text generation using the prompt.
A man in a space suit holding a sign that says help me.
Wow. Bam,
nailed it. Now for a more challenging text prompt,
a neon sign in a futuristic city that says like and follow
Matt Farmer AI. Wow.
Okay, stable diffusion 3 is amazing.
It is starting off with only API access.
If you want a video on how to use it via API,

Adobe just announced new AI features for Premiere Pro
and they are insane. Not only are we getting a new version of Firefly
for generative fill in video,
they're integrating with Open AI,
Sora, Pika and runway video generation.
Check out the video they released.
Adobe is using the power of generative AI
to deliver the most advanced and precise editing tools ever
in Premiere Pro.
Let's take a look at some features coming soon
powered by our new Adobe Firefly video model
that will transform how editors work.
One common editing challenge is finding something in a shot
you need to add or replace.
The Object Edition feature in Premiere Pro
combined with Adobe's Firefly video model
lets you add or change objects in footage with a text prompt.
Make a selection, write a prompt and add anything you can imagine.
These diamonds were created by the Firefly video model
currently in development
and not only can you add objects,
but you can easily remove them too.
Object removal with AI based Smart Masking
makes selecting and removing objects across frames quick and precise.
Here this distracting utility box is removed. With Firefly,
remove unwanted props,
crew or gear or copyrighted elements like brand logos.
And with Premiere Pro, all your edits are non destructive.
So you can always get back to your original footage
when your clip is too short
and you wanna hold on a shot or a character for An extra beat
generative extend intelligently adds frames with Firefly
extending your footage so you have the exact media you need,
like here where we extend this shot of the woman a few frames.
As we continue to innovate,
we're committed to transparency through the use of content credentials
now coming to Premiere Pro
so you always know whether AI
was used in the creation of the media you're viewing.
We can't wait to bring these Firefly powered video
editing workflows to Premiere Pro
later this year. And there is more.
We're excited to share our explorations around
giving editors
the choice to use models that work best with their footage.
Here are some early examples of how third party
generative AI models could look within Premiere Pro,
like pika powering generative extend to make a scene flow better
from open AI.
Here's an example of their Sora model currently in early research,
generating B roll for any scene through simple text prompts.
Sora creates variations for you to choose from.
Here's the same use case now using Runway AI's video model,
generating a new video clip and adding it to the timeline in a snap.
And content credentials coming to Premier Pro this year
will always make transparent whether AI
was used and what model was used in the creation of media.
To recap, revolutionary features like Object, Add,
Remove, and Generative Extend
powered by the new Adobe Firefly video model
are coming to Premiere Pro
and we're excited.
To show early research explorations with our friends at Open AI
Runway and pika.
So editors have the freedom to use the best model for their project.
It's Adobe Premiere Pro supercharged by AI.
Of course, when it launches,
I'll be doing a full review,

Then add a prompt, a line in the forest. Bam.
Majestic lion in the forest.
Not bad at all. But I have to be honest,
it is very buggy when adding items to the image.
I tried to add a bird. Nope,
it wouldn't do it. Then I selected the lion and added the prompt,
remove lion from the forest.
It replaced it with the bird I was asking for.
Okay, new feature.

operated by Oak Ridge National Laboratory

The purpose of this supercomputer is scientific
research and development, has an estimated cost of only $600 million.
Stargate is literally going to be over 150 times more expensive.

phase 4 system would cost less than,
may launch as soon as 2,026.
Target can need so much power,

Not only that, but they gave it a needle in a haystack test,

Another big upgrade is improved reasoning capabilities.

U test consists of, comparing it to G P t Four's 86.4%.

We will release an amazing new model this year.
I don't know what we'll call it.
So that goes to the question of like what
what's the way we release this thing?
We'll release over in the coming months many different things.
I think that'd be very cool.
I think before we talk about like a G P t 5
like model called that or called are not called that
or a little bit worse
or a little bit better than what you'd expect from a G P T5.
And then we have a lot of other important things to release first.
I don't know what to expect from G P t 5.
You're making me nervous and excited.
Uh, what are some of the biggest challenges in bottle necks to overcome
for whatever it ends up being called
but let's call it G P t 5.
Just interesting to ask what are is it on the compute side
is in the technical side always all of these.
I was I was I was, you know,
what's the one big unlock?
Is it is it a bigger computer?
Is it like a new secret? Is it something else?
Um, it's all of these things.
Together like the thing that opening I think does really well,
this is actually an original Ilia quote that I'm gonna butcher
but it's something like
we multiply 200 medium sized things together into one giant thing.
So there's this distributed constant innovation happening. Yeah,
so even on the technical side,
like especially on the technical side,
but let's break it down. GBT5 will be an uplift across everything

in the next couple of months.

how YouTube may not even be able to train from their own videos,
but open AI has likely scraped the entire site for training.
Very interesting point. At this rate,
open AI is going to become more of a legal company than an AI company.

Does open AI have the right to train off any data

agent called Simma that can play video games.
So now when AI takes our jobs,
it will be able to play video games for us too.
Great. Simba stands for Scalable Instructable Multi world Agent.
It differs from other AI systems for video games
and that it takes a broad approach
learning in a variety of environments
rather than focusing on one or few specific tasks.
Why is this a big deal? Research shows
an agent trained in many video games
performs better than an agent specialized in a single game.
Themma does not require access to the game source code,
only screen images and natural language instruction.
The agent interacts with virtual environments via keyboard and mouse
and is therefore potentially compatible with any virtual environment.
It has simulmastered 600 basic skills such as navigation,
object interaction and menu control.
The team expects future agents to be able to perform complex
strategic planning and multi faceted tasks.

robot company that is partnered with Open AI
has released a new video of its robot using GPT Vision.
Check this out.
It's creepy.
Hey, figure 1, what do you see right now?
I see a red apple on a plate in the center of the table,
a drying rack with cups and a plate
and you standing nearby with your hand on the table.
Great. Can I have something to eat, boys?
Sure thing.
Great. Can you explain why you did what you just did
while you pick up this trash
on it? So I gave you the apple because it's the only
edible item I could provide you with from the table.
Great. So based on the scene right now,
where do you think the dishes in front of you go next?
The dishes on the table like that plate and cup
are likely to go into the drying rack next.
Great. Can you put them there?
Of course.
So
let's see.
Alright, so how do you think you did?
I, I think I did pretty well.
The apple found its new owner.
The trash is gone
and the tableware is right where it belongs.
I agree. Thanks, figure 1.
You're welcome.
If there's anything else you need help with,
just let me know.
What do you think?
That's pretty crazy.
I'll do another video covering the figure

Engineer Agent,
dubbed as the first AI AGI agent.
This is not a normal AI agent.
They've made huge advances
in long term reasoning and planning,
which is one of the biggest problems with AI agents.
It is so good
they did a job on Upwork with no human intervention.
Check this out.
So here's actual real job from Upwork
where the client wants to set up this
computer vision model,
which actually looks quite interesting,
seems very difficult to set up.
Um, I'm not sure how I would start doing this.
But you know,
you give the test to Devon
and ask Devon to figure it out and things just kick off.
Devon immediately goes ahead
and you can see it sort of start setting up the repo.
It actually runs into some issues here
with the versioning.
So if you watch how Devon deals with it,
Devon's actually
updating the code to make these things work.
He continues with this loading and importing packages.
You can see that actually downloads
images from the internet to run through the model.
You can see here that there are actually some issues
that come across.
However, Devon knows how to handle these things.
Devon kinda pushes through.
And if you look closely,
Devon's actually doing print line d bugging here
where Devon is adding these statements
to track where the data flows.
And Devon continues to do this until
Devon understands how Everything's working
and actually then updates the code
with the fixes after removing print line statements.
Devon continues this pattern of fixing code
and running it again
until it runs
the image model across all these roads across the world.
And we can ask for a report from Devon,
at which point Devon sends over some sample images
of roads with damage marked out
and a nice TXT file
explaining Devon's work
and the different kinds of outputs of the model.
Good job, Devon.
Devon can plan and execute complex engineering tasks
requiring thousands of decisions.
Devon can also recall relevant
contacts that every single step,
learn over time
and fix mistakes.
The interface comes with a command line window
code editor where it writes the code
and a browser to
research everything it needs for the project.
Visit the blog to watch more videos on
some of the tasks that is able to autonomously complete.
It is crazy.
Devon is not released yet
but will likely drop soon.
I'll be testing it when it launches.

Here is how you can create these videos. Part 1,
AI lip sync.
You have two options,
paid or free.
In the video,
they're likely using a service called Sync Labs

Cut out a video clip from an interview,
upload the video clip and audio.
Let's look at the results.
My name is Jeff.

Bam. Sinklab service is paid
and you get around 20 minutes a month for $19.

agents and tasks.
It already has a ton of agents similar to GBTs

I added a sous chef to show you an example.
Make a pizza.
The output is beautiful.
It even shows the amount of tokens you have used.
It has multi modal capabilities
supporting vision models,
speech interactions
with both speech to text and text to speech.
I can click a button and Bam,
it reads the recipe to me.
It also includes a plugin system
which allows extensions of core capabilities,
function calling plug ins
enabling real time information retrieval,
data processing
and customization to boost functionality significantly.
One example is the Dolly 3 plugin.

benchmarks test different aspects of AI capabilities
from reasoning and understanding
the logic and mathematical skills.
Currently, this is the best way to compare AI model. M m
L U stands for massive Multitask Language understanding.
It is the most respected
and most used benchmark for overall
performance of large language models like G B T4
Gemini and Claude 3.
The test includes multiple choice questions,
problem solving tasks
and reasoning questions that test a model's ability
to process complex information.
It uses a mix of hand collected datasets
with around 15,000 question.
It then averages a model's performance per category
for a final score.
Some examples of subjects
they include our college biology,
formal logic,
high school physics.
The test is very comprehensive.
There's a large debate on if these
benchmarks are actually a good assessment tool.
Companies including Google with its Gemini model
often highlight superior
performance on these benchmarks.
They may not accurately reflected L L

AI is changing daily.
Here are the best large language model chat bots
you can use for free.
1. 3 a new model released by anthropic.
You can use a medium model
Sunnet for free on Cloud Dot AI.
Slightly less powerful than G P T4
but a great model overall
probably one of the best for creative writing.
No. 2 perplexity
one of the most underrated alternatives.
You can choose the sources.
It provides
information on where the answers are coming from.
It even has G P
t four built in as a co pilot
make the quality of the output even higher.
Best of all
it comes with lots of free usage.
No.3 Mistral Le Chat.
They provide access to their three models large
next and small at no cost.
Mistral is a very impressive L L.
M and it could be very good at advanced reasoning.
No. 4 Google Gemini
free access to the non advanced models.
A lot of bad press on Google Gemini lately
but to be honest
the model isn't that bad and a good free option. No.5 Po.
This website hosts a ton of free models like Mistral
Llama 2, Claude 3.
They do require subscription for some models
but overall
good site if you want to use the best free chat bots.
And No. 6 chat GBT.
You can get completely free access to GBT 3.5
which honestly isn't the best. I'd
Rather use perplexity and then use the GBT4 co pilot
when I wanna access GBT4.
What's your favorite free large language model?

a bear standing on a chair holding a duck.
Bam. By far the best at prompt adherents I have seen.
Wow. They also have added magic prompt.
I find it further increases accuracy on images.
With text and prompt adherents,
you get 25 free generations per day,
which is reasonable.

and throbbing has launched an absolute GBD4 killer
Claude 3. It comes with three different models
at different prices and capabilities.
The first model is Haiku.
It is lined up to compete with G P t 3.5
has lower cost
and beats it significantly in the benchmarks like m m L
U. The second model is sunnet.
This model is less expensive than G P t 4
and meant for a balance between speed and capabilities.
And the last model is Opus.
It outperforms GBD4 and benchmarks.
It does have a higher cost than GBD4
but meant for complex tasks.
Let's take a look at the stats.
They all support 2 hundred k context at launch
but will support as high as 1 million tokens
in the future.
The recall was tested using needle in a haystack
and it has improved significantly.
They claim it is near perfect recall.
It also had improvements in incorrect refusals.
Flood was previously coined as the Ned Flanders model
due to it having really sensitive guardrails,
improved accuracy
and the model support multimodal
with the ability to process images. Impressive.
This is a massive jump in competition in the AI market.
You can try the new Claude 3 on Claude dot AI

Mistral large.
We have a new GPT
competitor released from the French AI company Mistral.
For my test,
it's very impressive.
I would say it's slightly under GPT4 performance,
but a decent alternative.
Let's look at the cost comparison.
GPT4 is at one cent per thousand tokens and Mr large,
its price lower
at point eight of a cent per thousand tokens.
They also released Mistral Le Chat,
a web interface where you could use Mistral Small,
next and large for free,
which is Le great.
The model is quite slow overall,
I would say significantly slower than GPK4.
Hopefully groc will host it at 500 tokens per second.
Some other important information is
it supports a 32 k context.
It also only has slight censorship.
I would say overall less censored than GPT4.
Other big thing that happened is Microsoft is
now partnered with Mistral as well.
So now Microsoft is partnered with Open AI,
Metis Lama and now Mistral crazy.
Let's hope they're not Skynet.

Agility Digit.
This series is another one of my passions.
Humanoid robots
progress we're seeing because of AI is insane
and they will be everywhere soon.
My goal in life is to get a humanoid
robot that can make me food,
clean up and perform other tasks.
Basically my own C3PL.
Today we're looking at Agility's Digit.
Company's mission is to build highly efficient, agile
and robust leg platforms for real world applications.
It is designed for tasks such as last mile delivery,
unloading trailers
and moving totes and packages.
The robots move more like a person,
making them effective in a world built for humans.
Here are some of the other features.
It pauses when it perceives a person
slash barrier in its path and navigates around it.
It could crouch,
rotates the upper body to gaze
and look in different directions. Uses arms,
hands and feet to balance when bumped.
Ability to pick up and put down
objects of varying sizes and weights,
step up and down from curves.
It could even get back up after falling.
Let's look at the stats.
Height is 5 foot 9 at 141 pounds
and it can carry 35 pounds.
It can operate 16 out of the 24 hours
and has the ability to autonomously charge itself.
Agility says it plans to start shipping
the latest version of digit in year 2025.
Company hasn't set a price tag yet.
It expects a robot to cost less than the previous
version Of digit,
which was priced at 250,000.

AI agents are the future of how we use AI.
They give you the ability to do
complex tasks autonomously with AI.
In 2023, we saw the first AI agent released, auto GPT.
During the year,
new agents released with expanded capabilities
like Chat Dev and Autogen
that allowed you to run a group of agents,
each specializing in a task.
Here are my top AI agents in 2024.
No. 1, open interpreter.
It released in 2023.
Still one of my favorite agents.
An AI agent that is able to do tasks
directly on your computer,
change the themes,
cut up and transcribe videos,
almost anything.
It is very powerful.
No. 2, Crew AI
designed to enable AI agents to assume roles,
share goals,
and operate in a cohesive unit to complete tasks.
Supports local LMS,
native Lang chain support.
Overall, more flexible,
customizable
and better for setting up
agent collaboration like teams.
Also way easier to use than chat dev or auto gen.
No.3, multi on a new AI
agent that is able to complete tasks in your browser.
I can confidently say it's the best AI
agent currently on the market.
It can do almost anything
and I really mean it.
Schedule events in your calendar,
do research
and automatically create tweets about it.
Possibilities are almost endless.
It still has a wait list,
but I would sign up here.
In my opinion,
agents are the path to AGI and will
Be the most significant developments in AI this year.

Stable Diffusion 3 looks like the most capable AI
image generator to date,
surpassing predecessors like Dolly 3
and Mid Journey Version 6
in terms of prompt understanding,
text and image quality.
It uses a new type of diffusion transformer
similar to Sora
combined with flow matching and other improvements,
which includes support for multi modal inputs
like speech to image.
It will likely enable video 3D and more.
So we may see a Sora competitor from this.
Let's check out some of the examples they posted on X.
Cinematic photo of a red
apple on a table in a classroom.
On a blackboard are the words go big or go home
written in chalk.
You can see
the text generation here is really impressive.
A painting of an astronaut riding a pig wearing a tutu
holding a pink umbrella on the ground.
Next to the pig is a Robin bird wearing a top hat
in the corner are with the words stable diffusion.
This one shows how impressive the prompt adherence is
for this model.
If it's as good as these examples,
then we may have a new king ingenerative AI.
It's not available yet.
It has a waitlist to gain access.
You can sign up here.
They will release an open source after the feedback
and improve in phase.
The model ranges from 800 million to 8 billion
parameters to upgrade your video cards.

Google Gemma.
Google just released a family of lightweight
state of the art open models
built from the same research and technology
used to create the Gemini models.
So far they have released a 2 and 7 billion
parameter model with the option of base or instruct.
The 7 billion model is able to beat Mistral 7B
and Llama 2 13B in the mmlu benchmark,
which is impressive.
Also slightly winds on the Hella Swag bench.
Overall it beats Llama 2 in everything.
It's not completely open source,
but they have released the weights for it.
How good is it for my test to 7?
B is quite good
with basic AI tasks to be had.
A lot of issues with basic information
like listing the 50 US states.
Both models have issues with coding.
Smaller models typically are not the best
with advanced logic and coding.
It can be fine tuned and has an AK context window.
Google's approach to
ethical AI development includes pre processing
for sensitive content,
aka it is very censored.
If you wanna try it out,
it's pretty much everywhere
like Google collab.
The easiest way to run it is with hugging face spaces.
LM Studio has an update to support it,
but still has some issues with the quantized versions.

Bam, that was quick.
Now prompt adherents,
a bear standing on a chair holding a duck.
It got close,
not perfect.
Prompt adherents,
it made a duck bear hybrid
and it was sitting on the chair instead of standing.
Next is text.
It has no issues doing basic text,
but long form text.
It has issues like every other generator.
It utilizes subversion
architecture with a smaller latent space
leading to faster inference and cheaper training.
A 16 x cost reduction and fine tuning
compared to stable diffusion 1.5
making model development more accessible.
Also has features built in like image to image
in painting,
outpainting
control net canny edge,
super resolution
upscaling and image reconstruction
available from the start.
How do you use it?
I'd recommend using one of the hugging face spaces
for this one.
It recommends around 20 gigabytes of V
RAM to run locally,
which is a lot compared to SDXL.
This model is also being released under a non
commercial license.

that are specialized for each task.
Gemini 1.5 Pro also demonstrates superior
performance in creative writing and marketing copy,
showing a notable improvement over previous models
like GBT4. The next feature is insane.
It comes with 128 context tokens,
but they have a developer version that supports
one million tokens.
Not only that,
it has an unbelievable recall rate of over 99%.
Typically models like GPT4 Turbo have large context,
but can only really recall 73K
of the total 128K tokens before you start to lose data.
And Claude has an even lower ability to recall context
during the research
for this model,
they're able to get similar results
with 10 million tokens.
Unbelievable.

I've added all the channels I watch and it
automatically summarizes all the new videos for me.
Easy. I love it.
You don't have to copy and paste the YouTube video link.

video to just a few minutes without losing any key
insights. Webin,
mobile apps.
It has a web app along with an iOS and an Android app.

One of the biggest issues with AI
large language models is the speed it generates. Text,
they're fast,
but for production systems,
not fast enough.
Grok is an inference company,
meaning they host the models
and you could connect to them via API,
which is two to four times faster than all competitors.
Not to be confused with Elon's Grok or Grimes Rock.
Typically speed is around 20 tokens per second on G P
t 4. Turbo Rock can hit around 500 tokens per second.
Let me show you how fast it is running.
Mixed roll 8 x 7
b model lists the 50 states in the United States.
Bam, look at that.
Almost 500 tokens per second. Impressive.
Even faster than going directly to Mistral for API.
They achieve this using LPUs,
a language processing unit inference engine.
They believe GPUs
alone are the weakest link in the generative
AI ecosystem right now.
You need to request API
access as they're rolling it out.
But if you're using AI for agents or making production
AI for business,
this service is amazing.

The FCC just banned AI calls.
This was likely because of the fake Biden robo call
telling Democrats not to vote
that used an AI generated deepfake.
The details are interesting.
Let me cover exactly what it means.
This ban only affects unsolicited calls.
What is still allowed?
I talked to my friend Mondo from Talk AI dot co
who helped me test all the AI call systems like Air AI,
Simple Talk
and a handful of other providers.
You can still use AI systems for calls that have opted
in to receive the calls.
Typically, most good actors in the space
only do this type of calling,
but the bad actors
have been making thousands of calls per hour.
You can also use the AI callers for incoming calls
like support and appointment booking.
If you want to get set up with a legal and ethical
system like this,
talk to an expert.
I'd recommend Mondo from tokai..
Co and get set up properly and legally.
I don't think anyone opposes this ban.
Nobody wants AI phone spam.
So this is overall good for the industry and humanity.
If you hate unsolicited calls,
like and follow.

any of these calls in Canada.

New technology is not good or evil in and of itself.
It's all about how people choose to use it.
AI technology is already being used to scam people,
spread misinformation
and other diabolical uses.
Here's the current dark side of AI.
A deep fake incident involved a fake AI
generated image of an explosion outside the Pentagon
in which briefly went viral.
Robo call in New Hampshire
impersonating President Joe Biden with AI voice cloning
aim to discourage democratic voters before the primary.
Countless deepfakes are being used as scam ads.
Elon Rogan, these ads are everywhere.
Here is part of one I found on meta.
If you don't make your first million in six months,
I will personally give you a Tesla Model 3.
And of course,
the Taylor Swift incident
where she was deep faked into some lewd images.
Now more than ever,
it is important to be diligent
and not believe everything you see and read.
Confirming sources of information
is important before you share or believe information.
And if an ad of Elon is claiming to make you rich,
probably a scam.
Careful out there.
This is just gonna get worse before it gets better.
Share this video.
The only way to counter this trend is with education
and awareness.","ainews, ai, deepfake",https://p16-sign-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tos-maliva-p-0068/fd674e0621c745e1948c809858009667_1707268676?lk3s=81f88b70&x-expires=1724050800&x-signature=rf%2FvYVbhsjyRXzPPgZ%2FG6CZLYRQ%3D,https://v16-webapp-prime.tiktok.com/video/tos/useast2a/tos-useast2a-v-27dcd7/o8AQWMBiC3yBGst2LpiCAi4KEgkBwo0k5IfXc4/?a=1988&bti=ODszNWYuMDE6&ch=0&cr=0&dr=0&er=0&lr=default&cd=0%7C0%7C0%7C0&br=250&bt=125&ft=GNDpcInz7Th0rw-rXq8Zmo&mime_type=audio_mpeg&qs=6&rc=aGY5NDk1Nzg3N2Q3ODM0aEBpM3I4NXE5cmtncTMzNzU8M0BfYTE0LmNeNmIxLS0xYjReYSMwbXNsMmRjaC5gLS1kMTZzcw%3D%3D&btag=e00090000&expire=1723884094&l=20240817074028112784B408ED9B54EA43&ply_type=3&policy=3&signature=8173a046162a321074653e40d25fad3f&tk=0,2/6/2024

Google Bard Image Generator.
Google Bard can now generate images.
Let's test it out.
I used my typical prompt.
It was quite creative,
but not the best generator.
It has some other really good attributes though.
It is amazing at text generation.
Probably the best image generator I've used for text.
Short, firm text,
no problem at all.
I had to generate Hello World on a sign.
Easy. 100% of the images were correct.
Now let's challenge it a bit more
with a neon sign that says Matt Farmer AI Bam.
It even had reflections.
It had issues with long text generation,
but still No. 1 for text generation.
Now on to prompt adherents.
For my experience with generators,
this is the most important feature.
I usually test this with a bear standing on a chair
holding a duck.
It actually nailed it better than any other generator.
Very impressive.
I'll be using Bard Image Generator for this alone.
How do I rate it? It's free.
It has good prompt adherents.
Does text. For creative art,
I'll be using Leonardo,
but I give it a pass.

This story is crazy.
Out of nowhere,
a new large language model was put on hugging face
that almost achieved G P T4 performance on the EQ bench.
It was posted by the user Miku Dev.
This doesn't happen every day.
A model comes out,
beats everything in the world except G P T4.
So speculation started.
Then Mystero confirmed that an over
enthusiastic employee of an early access customer
had released a quantized and watermarked version
of an old model trained by Mystero
based on Meta's Llama 2.
Pretty much the unreleased
quantized Mystero Medium model.
Although it was released without an official license,
Mistral is gonna keep it on hugging face. So
if Mistral had this beastly model and didn't release it,
they likely have something better.
Interesting.
You wanna try it out?
You can download a quantized version with LM Studio.
It supports 32 k context.
I've tried it myself.

Open AI announced some new updates today.
Let's dive in.
First, G P t 4 o 1 25 preview.
Better code generation,
reduce cases of laziness
where the model doesn't complete a task.
The knowledge cut off for this model is April 2023.
Not a bad update.
Token cost is still the same.
Updated GP 3.5 Turbo with various
improvements in 50% cost reduction on input tokens
and 25% cost reduction in output tokens.
Updated moderation model to help developers
identify harmful text boring.
Two new embedding models,
text embedding 3 small
and text embedding 3 large with lower prices.
This model has been updated since December 22nd, 2022.
Beddings make it easy for machine learning models
and other algorithms to understand
relationships between content
and to perform tasks like clustering or retrieval.
As a developer,
this is a huge update.
Better reporting on API keys.
You can now view usage by key.
You just need to enable the tracking for each key.
Bam. You can also set permissions on
API keys and limit the models they can use.
That's it. No GBT 4.5.

or even edit different parts of the video.
Wow. These look great.
Change outfits,
do anything.
You try it out.

It doesn't just generate a beat.
It will make the lyrics and vocals mind blowing
and basically free.
No. 2, illustroke.
Use AI to create vector illustrations from a prompt.
Perfect for making logos,
icons and other vector based images.
No.3, Doctor Gupta,
a complete AI doctor trained on medical information.
It even has Doctor Mcgrath,
an AI vet for your animals.
No.4, Fathom.
I've tried all the meeting co pilots.
Fathom is my favorite.
It records meetings,
provides a transcript.
I used it to save a ton of time
creating proposals automatically from meetings.
No.5, Face Fusion. Use AI
to completely swap your face with anyone you want
and video or images.
The Rock Mr Beast Arnold.
This one is fun and free to install.
I would use Pinocchio Dot Computer to install it.
No.6, voice AI,
real time AI voice changer.
That is impressive.
It has hundreds of voices to choose from.
You're listening to David Attenborough.
Great to mix with Face Fusion.
And No. 7, my Markie.
Generate social media posts from your website content.

Real time voice translations.

translate verbally or via text
with real world conversations.

Expressive styles,
translate style of your communication to chill,
excited, formalize
or my favorite
Shakespeare.
Turn photos into reactions by removing the background.
Android Auto also got a huge update
and now has built in AI.
Auto summarizes group messages,
navigate to a destination you were text,
share your ETA and quick replies.
Transcript assist.
Take notes in Voice Recorder,
use it to record lectures or in person conversations
and it'll split up the voice
and provide summary and notes.
Notes assist,
summarize or reform at your notes.
This actually is really useful.
AI search, circle highlight,
scribble, search anything.
You can circle an item from any platform
and it'll search it.
Let's say you wanna
see where to get an influencer's merch,
circle it. Bam.
Pro vision engine,
massive zoom in night photography,
ability to do AI edits,
camera lens upgrades,
AI analysis of images and touch up images automatically.

dream moving.
This AI tool is going to replace Tiktokers.
It is a diffusion based
controlable video generation framework.
Produce high quality customized human videos.
In simple terms,
upload your face and it can make you dance with AI.
Let's check out some of the examples.
Upload your face and you can either use a guided
style generation with video and text
or just a text to video prompt.
Results are impressive.
AI movement is getting really good.
How does it work?
Removing features of Video Control net,
which integrates motion blocks into an image
control net,
processing control sequences
like pose or depth for a temporal detail.
Additionally,
it uses d noising unit
adapted from stable diffusion for video
and a content guider that translates
text prompts and appearance
inputs into content embeddings for cross attention.
So simple. Why didn't I think of that?
You wanna try it out?
It has a free example on hugging face at no cost
and will likely be releasing the code soon.
I had issues with the hugging face demo,
but it may be working now.

Pro AI is the latest and best AI agent framework.
Here's a step by step guide on installing it.
First step is make sure you install
get from this URL.
Next step, install Anaconda prompt.
From this URL,
Launch Anaconda,
create a new environment with this command.
I'm using Python 3.11 in this example.
Now activate your new environment with this command.
You can tell it's activated here.
Time to install crew AI using this command.
For the example we are using,
also run this command.
Okay, we're good to go.
I'm not using VS code for this.
This is how you run the example.
Go to get hub and scroll down,
hit the copy button on the example
and paste it into notepad.
You'll need to add your open AI
G P. T 4 key.
You can create one here and just paste it in.
Let's review the code.
The first step is defining agents.
Set the role,
set the goal,
give them a backstory and assign any tools.
The second part of the code is assigning
tasks for the agents.
The last part is to instantiate your crew.
Basically adding in all the agents and tasks
and get the crew ready to work.
Now save the file with this file name
and the director you created.
Go back to Anaconda prompt
and use this command to run it.
Bam, it runs.
The agent will assign the work,
use the tools and the Output is really good.
This is just getting started.
I'd recommend trying the examples from Github
and make small changes
before you start to create an entire workforce.

a new AI agent framework is out.
This new tool is blowing up.
Crew AI is designed to enable AI agents to assume rules,
share goals,
and operate in a cohesive unit to complete tasks.
What are the benefits?
It is really easy to use.
Install is simple
and the setup is also easy.
Native lang chain support,
ability to support local
large language models and other models like Mixtral.
Agents can delegate tasks
and inquire amongst themselves,
which improves problem solving
efficiency and collaboration between agents.
Currently only support sequential task execution,
but this is being expanded on.
Is it better than the current king Autogen?
After a couple of tests,
I would say yes.
It's more flexible,
customizable
and better for setting up agent collaboration
like teams. Also way easier to use.
How much does it cost?
Nothing. Open source and free.

These are the tools
not many people know about that I love. Number one,
core 3 d AI to design your own custom clothing.
This is one of my favorite tools.
I used it to design my merch store,
dot mat farmer
dot AI plug

hats, shirts, anything.
No. 2, Pluto,
a complete Investing co pilot.
This tool is beautiful
and I use it daily to get updates on my portfolio,
news, everything.

It's the end of the year,
time to put on an AI award show.
Today we have the best AI image generators.
I bet you won't be able to guess who I placed first.
Sixth place,
stable Diffusion XL,
a beautiful free generator
that you can host locally on your computer.
Released in July.
This is one of the best image generators.
Fifth place,
Adobe Firefly.
The first version was bad,
but version 2 has the ability to generate images
that are so real they look like stock images.
Fourth place,
Idiogram. Launched in August.
It was the first
generator to successfully include text in images.
It isn't perfect,
but it's getting better every release.
Third place,
mid journey generates beautiful images.
It's been one of the best on the market since release.
It still has some issues of prompted hearings
even after the version 6 update.
Second place, Dolly 3,
my most used image generator.
Not always the best quality,
but I find it the most
useful because of its almost perfect prompted hearings
and ability to include text and generations.
And first place,
Leonardo AI.
I find Leo is the best mix of everything.
Beautiful, creative images,
prompt adherents features,
web interface,
simple video generation,
live canvas.
Leo wins the Matt Farmer 2023 AI Image Generator.

Google Video Poet,
a new generative AI system that can create and edit
videos from text and other inputs.
Here are some examples.
A skeleton drinking a glass of soda,
a motorcycleist on a racing track,
a rabbit eating grass,
two pandas playing cards,
a pumpkin exploding,
slow motion,
a massive explosion.
This generator has incredible understanding of motion.
Wow, but wait,
there's more. A lot more.
It includes visual
narratives to add on to existing videos,
like adding a meteor shower to your video.
It's capable of longer video generation
by predicting one second of video output.
Given an input of a one second video clip,
this process could be repeated
indefinitely to produce a video of any duration.
Controlable video editing,
edit a subject to follow different motions.
They give an example of making a raccoon
dance in multiple ways.
Image to video capabilities,
controllable camera motion,
stylization of videos using a simple prompt,
and even applying different visual
styles to the same video.
Bam. Can you try it out?
Not yet. Google just release the research paper,
but I'm sure they'll be releasing it soon.

Starting with my typical prompt to man in a space suit

Damn, I'm amazed at the quality of this new feature.
Here are some forest videos.
Wow, it does a great job on smooth generation.
Let's test out some animals.
Time to go full David Attenborough.
Here we have a majestic lion sitting in the forest

We have monkeys looking for the next reel.
Now we have a herd of Mammoth elephants.
Leonardo is free to sign up and comes with 100 tokens

mid journey is about to launch version 6,
the much awaited big update.
I just checked my account and got beta access.
Let's try it out.
First starting with my typical prompt.
Massive upgrade.
Bam. Looks amazing and follows the prompt. Nice.
Let's test realism.
One of the biggest upgrades I see is in
the realism of people,
objects and robots.
They're all looking even better.
Prompt adherents.
This one was one of the biggest issues with version 5.
My test, a bear holding a duck standing on a chair.
Much better.
Here's the same prompt on version five.
Maybe even on par with Dolly 3,
which is impressive.
On V5, I had issues with my man in a spacesuit prompt
and I'm not seeing similar issues now.
Text testing some signs.
I was able to actually nail the odd image with text.
Very impressive.
Not perfect,
but either is Dolly 3 or Idiogram.
So it looks like it has some text abilities.
Overall, the model looks even better.
Better prompt adherents,
better everything.
Just a reminder,
this is beta
model will likely be even better when it releases
and could possibly have even more features.
To check if you have beta access
type slash settings to the bot
and see if it's in the drop down.

AI agents are the future of how we use AI.
Agents give AI the ability to do complex tasks
that would take multiple prompts
like creating software,
testing it, debugging,
fixing code
and writing documentation
automatically from one base prompt.
No.1, auto GBT released first.
This was the first step into AI agents.
Worked really well,
but sometimes gets in loops and doesn't finish the task.
No.2, chat dev.
One agent was not enough.
Chat dev basically started multi agents
where you can have individual agents like a coder,
code reviewer,
a CEO, basically set up an entire business.
The results,
even better.
No. 3, Autogen.
Microsoft would not be ho done.
They released Autogen.
What's different?
Instead of multiple agents being able to talk
one on one like chat dev,
you're able to make groups of
agents that communicate with each other.
This is currently the most powerful framework.
I not only did a review on every one of these agents,
but I also made an install guide for each.
I'm thinking about creating an AI agent guide.
Let me know if you're interested in the comments.

new large language model that everyone is talking about.
It uses a mixture of experts where
the model is divided into multiple expert networks,
each specializing in a different task.
Input goes through a gating network
and the experts are selected,
then combines the outputs together.
This is a method open AI likely uses.

Imagine meta has been a big player in the AI space
and they just released a new AI image generator.
Is it good? Let's try it out.
I used my standard prompt.
Interesting default style,
quite good overall.
Adding realistic to the prompt,
not bad, but it's not the best at realism.
Now prompted hearings,
a robot standing on a chair with a broom in one hand
and a laptop in the other.
It's actually not that bad.
Not as good as Dolly 3 for prompted hearings,
but beats mid journey in this category.
And to do text, not really.
I tried to put Skynet robot on a robot's chest.
Doesn't work that well,
but it nailed the Skynet look.
Okay, now let's test its ability to make hands
the Kryptonite of AI image generators.
An elderly couple holding hands
and it fails at most of the images.
It's free to use at imagine.metacom
unless you're Canadian,
then you need a VPN.
Overall, I'd say it's not awful,
but not the best.

This is Google's latest attempt to compete with Open AI
GPT4. It's actually very impressive
but has some issues.
It comes in three sizes,
Ultra, the most capable model,
Pro, a performance optimized model and Nano
designed to run on devices.
It directly compared it to GBD4 on the announcement,
which make it look like a clear winner,
but it was a little bit deceiving.
If you look at the research paper,
you can see the cherry picks of data
including a different approach for the main test, mmlu.
But regardless,
it wins in most categories like coding,
slightly leading in some and slightly losing in others.
Bottle is multi modal as well,
supporting text, images,
audio and more.
You wanna try it?
Gemini Pro is being used in Google's Bard.
You could use it right now.
The version that competes with GBT4 will release
early next year.

Of course, you can use chat GPT for this task,
but honestly
this method is a lot easier
and includes text in the images.
Go to mymarkie dot AI,
put in your website URL on the homepage.
It will scrape the website
and pull all the information needed.
Now select the templates you wanna generate,
make edits to change the content that is generated.
But it does a great job.
Bam, generating posts.
And here they are. That easy.
You can edit the post,
generate a new image,
change anything in the copy
or add your own image and keep the copy.
And all you need to do is save the post and Bam,
it is completely free to generate the post.
You do need to sign in to save the post
and schedule them.
Obviously this is a premium service,
but costs are extremely reasonable at $23 per month.
If you wanna make some money doing this,
I would set up a social media agency.
They have agency plans where you can
add multiple clients

Hey, I'm doing well.
Thanks for asking.
So I'm reaching out to learn more about your business
and understand your current strategies.
Can you tell me a bit about what
your business specializes in?
Yes, I have an artificial intelligence agency that helps
businesses implement artificial intelligence.
That's great to hear.
Are there specific challenges you're looking to address?
Yes, I was looking at your website
and I'm looking for an AI
call agent that's able to cold call
potential clients and businesses.
I see that's a common need for businesses.
How many team members do you
currently have managing calls for your business?
Do you have an estimate of your current
expenditure on appointment centers and closers?
AI calling has come a long way.

Microsoft just released a 13 billion
parameter large language model
that outperforms significantly larger
70 billion parameter models,
not only surpasses similar models
and models five to 10 times larger,
but is able to achieve enhanced reasoning abilities
which are typically only found in much
larger language models.
Orchid 2 comes in two sizes, 7B and 13B.
Both were created by fine tuning
the corresponding llama 2 base models on tailored
high quality synthetic data.
It was benchmarked covering a variety of aspects
including language understanding,
common sense reasoning,
multi step reasoning,
math problem solving,
reading comprehension,
summarizing,
roundedness,
truthfulness
and toxic content generation and identification.
Want to try it out?
I recommend using LM Studio.
I've been obsessed with this program lately,
stole it from LM Studio dot AI search for Orchid 2.
I recommend the blokes quantized version.
I use this one for slight loss
and ran several tests on it.
Very impressed.

Anthropic just released an update to Claude,
their open AI competitor.
Here are the new features.
It double the context window to 200 k,
which is roughly 150 k words
or 500 pages of information.
2 x decrease in false statements compared to quad 2.0.
We'll have to test how well it retains data at 200 k,
but this is an impressive upgrade.
Proved accuracy along documents,
30% reduction in incorrect answers
and a 3 to 4 x lower rate mistakenly
concluding a document supports a particular claim.
Upgrades to the developer experience
with a new workbench feature in the console
to make it easier for API users to test prompts.
New features have been added to Claude Dot AI
and the API.
On that note,
it's raw pick
if you're listening,
give a self serve API access,
please. Open AI is dead. We need it.

an animator
3D portrait generation that has controllable facial
expressions,
head pose and shoulder movements. Typically
head only videos don't have natural shoulder movement
and full body generations
typically don't deal with facial expression control.
This new tech can generate ultra realistic avatars
of the upper body with full movement.
You can even control the avatars with real video.
They provided some uncurated random generation results.
Compared to the other models like interfacecan,
it is a lot better at generating avatars.
For training,
they applied a dual camera rendering scheme with
two images separated,
rendered in 3 discriminators employed.
This tech will have countless applications.
It is not out yet,
but they plan to release the code on Github,
which I will be reviewing when it's live.

We are now in a new era of AI video generators.
Runway just
did a massive update to their video generator
and it looks really good.
Let's try it out.
I started with text generation.
In my typical prompt
you can select the motion. Bam.
Looks really good.
Still has flaws
but a big upgrade overall.
Now let's try to animate an image.
Not the best motion
but a new feature is coming soon called Motion Brush
where you can add motion to specific parts of the video.
The demo they provided is amazing.
Look at the effect.
I don't have the feature yet in my Runway ML account
but you know
I'll be reviewing it when I do.
Alright, so they just took first place in
the industry from Pica Labs
but Pica has announced a
new video generator that will be available soon.
Also runway is not free.
It starts at about $15 per month.
I had to pay for this one
so like and follow would be appreciated.

GBT4 turbo 128 k context
actually recall 128,000 tokens accurately.
No, what is context in a large language model?
It is basically the memory or the number of tokens
the model can take his input when generating responses.
Red Camera did some research on this and posted it on X.
Give him a follow.
He spent around $200 testing,
used a method called needle in a haystack,
which is a brilliant method
where you put a sentence in different parts of
218 essays and test the ability of the LLM to recall it.
This method could give an idea on
the accuracy of the GPT4 Turbo context.
The results,
performance started to degrade at about 73,000 tokens.
When using over 73,000 tokens,
middle of the document had less retention
in the 7 to 50% area.
The end of the context
had even more accuracy than the beginning as well.
Although 128 k,
it's a massive update.
You wanna make sure
you're sending as little context as possible.

You can now customize your branding by choosing colors,
font, and even add in your logo.
Also now you can link your website
instead of having to add in all your brand information.
When you generate post,
you can choose post from a grid
or tinder style interface.
It also schedules the post for you,
which is a great feature.
Big update. They significantly dropped the price.
It was 197 a month.
Now it's only $23 a month.
And they hooked me up with a promo code
for an additional 20% off.
Is it worth it? Yes.

So today we're using LM Studio,
the LM Swiss Army Knife. It is free.
Download it from LM Studio dot AI.
It works on both Windows and Mac.
Go through the install,
search any language models you want to use
and download it.
Click on the chat tab and select it from the drop down.
Bam. It is that easy.
Let's use the rest of the video to talk about
the different models.
I recommend using the blokes quantized models.
I typically download a medium lost quality model.
You would see this by hovering over the info icon.
You'll see two different types of models,
ggml and GG UF.
These run off your computer's RAM
which you will likely have more of than video RAM.
The LLMs run close to a 1 to 1 ratio
on parameters to RAM.
So if it's a 7 billion parameter model
it will likely take around 7 gigabytes of RAM to run.
See the requirements when choosing
the model in Elm Studio
which is helpful.
I will do a part 2 video with more configuration
but this is the best way to get up and running.

gpts create no code bots and sell them
announced by Open AI today at their Dev Day event.
This is huge.
Let's watch Sam Altman using this feature
so I'm gonna create a GPT that helps give founders
and developers advice when starting new projects
I'm gonna go to create a GPT here
and this drops me into the GPT Builder uh,
I worked with founders for years at YC
and still whenever I meet developers
the questions I get are always about how do I
you know think about a business idea?
Can you give me some advice?
I'm gonna see if I can build a GPT to help with that
to start GPT Builder asks me what I want to make
and I'm gonna say
I want to help start up founders
think through their business ideas
and get advice.
After the founder has gotten some advice,
grill them on why they are not growing faster
so to start off
I just tell the GPT a little bit about
about what I want here
and it's gonna go off and start thinking about that
and it's gonna write some detailed instructions
for the GPT.
Um, it's also gonna,
let's see, ask me about a name.
How do I feel about start a mentor?
That's fine uh,
that's good
so if I didn't like the name
of course I could call it something else
but it's you know
gonna try to have this conversation with me. And,
and start there
you can see here on, uh,
on on the right in the preview mode
that it's already starting to fill out the GPT
where it says what it does
it has some like
ideas of additional questions that I could ask and ha,
you know what actually
so I just generated a candidate
of course I could regenerate that or change it,
but I sort of like that
so I will say that's great.
And you see now that the GPT
is being dealt out a little bit more as we go
what I want this to do, um,
how it can interact with users
I could talk about style here
but what I'm gonna say uh,
is I am going to upload transcripts of some lectures
about startups
I have given.
Please give
advice based off of those now, uh,
it's gonna go figure out how to do that
and I would like to show you the configure tab
so you can see some of the things that were built
out here as we were going, um,
by by the builder itself
and you can see that there's capabilities here that I
can enable. Um,
I could add custom actions.
These are all fine to leave. Um,
I'm gonna upload a file.
So here is a lecture that I
picture that I used to
that I gave with some startup advice. Um,
and I'm gonna add that here
in terms of these questions, uh,
this Is a dumb one.
The rest of those are reasonable.
Uh, and like very much things founders often ask again,
if we had more time
I'd show you a bunch of other things
but this is uh,
this is like a decent start and now uh,
we can try it out over on this preview tab.
So I will say
what are three things to look for when hiring employees
at an early stage startup?
Now it's gonna look at that document I uploaded.
Um, it also have of course
all of the background knowledge of GPT4.
That's pretty good. Those
are three things that I definitely have said many times.
Uh, I'm gonna publish this only to me for now.
Uh, I can work on it later.
I can add more content.
I can add a few actions that I think will be useful.
Um, and then I can share it publicly.
So that's what it looks like to create a GPT.
Being able to easily create
and sell these bots is going to be a game changer in AI
plus 128 k context of GPT4
Turbo is going to make them really good.

The X AI team has been busy at work
and we will have a new chat GPT
competitor soon called Grok.
It was first announced by Elon Musk on X
saying tomorrow
X AI will release its first AI to a select group
and that it is in some important respects
the best that currently exist.
A day later,
as soon as it's out of early beta,
Xas Grog System will be
available to all X Premium subscribers,
which is currently $16 per month.
It is designed to have a little humor in responses
and gives examples of someone prompting to make drugs.
It is joking around with the response
recommending them against the activity.
Rock will contain real time information from
the X system.
They gave an example asking if it has any news on SPF.
It will also have a 25K context,
which is quite good.
Fast responses,
live search.
They plan an API,
image recognition and audio recognition,
what's going to be multimodal.
It will also run native in Tesla
using local compute power.
This looks like a serious chat GBT competitor.

Bam, full email.
You can choose the response
length, tone,
either cheeky,
casual, or formal,
or voice perspective, I or we.
Best feature by far is that it understands
the context of the email you are replying to.
Here's an example.
I emailed myself
looking to plan a meeting for next week.
I could just type the damn time.
Damn. It writes the entire email for me.
It comes with 10 free emails a month.
It has paid plans starting at $8.
I know a lot of you hate paid AI,
but let's look at the alternative.
I tried AI in my Google workspace for my agency
and Google was charging me $30 a month per user
for Palm 2 garbage.
I canceled it.

The image generator is actually really good.
Here are some examples
or use other generators like Mid Journey,
Adobe Firefly or Dolly 3.
It also has an explore
tab where you can look at the most popular stock images
to help you come up with the strategy.
To start, I'm uploading some seasonal images
for Thanksgiving and Christmas,
business images of offices
and stock images that would look good on websites.
Here are some of the images that I put online.
It even has creative challenges where you could sign up,
submit images
and win prize money.
Free users can submit five images or videos.
Paid plans can submit 100 images per month,
upscale 200 images,
master keywording
and reviews for the marketplace support

Pixar Alpha,
a new text to image diffusion model
has essentially broken the rules
on how these models are typically trained.
The images look amazing.
Here are some of the examples.
Super realistic
and very impressive results for such a new model.
What is special about this model,
the training efficiency is unmatched,
uses significantly less data usage and training time.
Pixar Alpha achieved an exceptionally
low training cost of only $26,000.
Only two took over $2 million worth of compute to train.
That's a big deal.
They only use 600 million parameters in
25 million images.
Wow. It's ports control net
where you could use a reference
image to generate new styles
and dreambooth
where you can upload a picture of a subject
and it will give you an option to generate images of
the subject in different poses and environments.
They released a Huggy face demo,
but it has been broken since release.

First question,
what do they mean by in its compute class?
After some digging,
they mean models trade with
at most the trading flops of Palm 5 40 b.
I tried to find the contact length,

Why is this exciting?
They will be releasing a technical bubble

the same compute class as POG2 and GBT4,
which has potential to beat GBT4.

Easily create AI content in your brand's voice,
blog post, social media content,
add copy, landing pages and more.
Let's try it out.
I set up a herbal guide voice
for the herbal remedy book that I advertise.
Once your voice is set up,
you can start generating content,
create a new project.
I'll call it everything
because that is what I wanna test it.
Create new Bam,
an absolute ton of content options. Blog post,
case studies,
press releases, Google ads,
Facebook ads,
organic social email,
SMS, and even website content.
Personal test Facebook ads,
put in some information about the product.
It generate Bam 6 ads.
They're a little bit shorter than I wanted,
so I hit right more a couple times
and it increases the ads length.
These are quite good and I'm gonna be testing them out.
Next test. Create landing page content,
which is always the hardest part.
Similar to the ads,
I provided some information.
It generated a ton of landing page content,
was really well written.
It hit right more and expand it.
This tool is great,
a lot easier than using Chat, GBT
and a higher quality since it's using the brand's voice.
Pricing starts at $20 per month
for pretty much unlimited generations 3 brand voices,
which is actually a great deal
considering how much content you could create.

Leonardo is packed full of features and it doesn't get
enough attention for the amazing images it produces.

First, the photo real model.
It generates hyper realistic images,
even comes with a couple of styles.
Results amazing.
Now let's try it with the new Leonardo Diffusion Excel
model with Prompt Magic version 3.
Prompt Magic increases
prompt inherits
so your images are actually what you want.
The journey thinks a
man in space is surrounded by coral and other sea life.
This new model is beautiful.
One of the latest features is elements,
basically allowing you to combine different image
generation models to create your own style.
I mix Pirate Punk with Dream Shaper.
The results incredible.
This is just scratching the surface on the features
and will require more videos to go over
the entire suite.
In my opinion,
this is the most creative image generator hands down.
Comes with 153 credits per day,
but also has very reasonable plans
starting at $12 a month
to use the more advanced features.

Why does this matter?
It previously only supported two countries,
the US and the UK.
If you're in a country that's not supported,
I have two workarounds at the end.
Overall, this is great news.
Claude 2 is better than GPT4
in my opinion
for some use cases,
has significantly larger memory than open AI
in chat, g, b, t.
It is between 4 k and 8 k.
Context odd 2 supports 100 k.
This is important when you're doing tasks
like summarizing content.
It is also better at writing tasks like ads and blogs.
It is still not allowed Canada and Europe.
Thank your government for that one.
Here's the workaround.
If you're outside the supported countries,
Po dot com is one of the best options
if you wanna access quad 2.
It does have daily limits,
but it's available in all countries.
You could also subscribe to Po
and get a lot of usage across
all of the large language models.
Second is VPN.
This one worked really well,
but for new sign UPS,
they require a phone number to verify the account.

Adobe Illustrator AI.
You can now do text to vector in Adobe Illustrator.
It does have limits I will cover at the end.
Let's try it out.
It has four different types. Subject,
you could create a vector of almost anything.
Scenery, create full vector scenes.
I had no issues doing a cyberpunk style
city and mountain landscape.
It turned out really detailed and artistic. Icon,
create icons.
I just had to create a cute robot.
Bam, no issues at all.
Pattern, create a repeating pattern.
I headed output some galaxy wallpapers. Quite good.
Each type has a toggle to match active artboard style
to match the current color scheme.
It even has AI recoloring tool built in where
you could easily change the color scheme of any vector.
Now text. It has no issues with basic text
like a stop sign or hello world.
But wasn't able to make a vector for Matt Farmer,
though it does have issues with advanced text.
For my testing,
I'm seriously impressed with some of the results.
And this is going to be a complete game changer
for anyone that uses Adobe Illustrator.

With AI, we have the potential
for the entire world to be connected like never before.
You can translate videos into any language
and now you have access to a worldwide audience.
11 Labs has just launched
a new feature that not only makes it possible but easy.
With 11 Labs dubbing,
you can either upload a video or link it directly from
YouTube, TikTok,
Twitter or Vimeo.
Let's test it out
with one of my recently popular videos, Chattav.
It even kept the background music.
Also, I talk fast English.
My fast Spanish is next level.
As for the cost,

Let me talk about the features
then give you an honest review at the end.
Great presentations with a prompt,
they show up
creating an onboarding. Not bad.
Magic video,
select video clips and photographs
and automatically edit them together with a prompt.
Magic switch.
Transform documents into different documents
like a brainstorm into a summary.
Language translation built in magic.
Right, right.
Content with AI
like a job description.
Change the tone into your brain voice.
Magic media.
They're using runway for video generation.
Image editing features like background Remover,
Eraser, or expand Images Edit.
So I tested the features and to be honest,
some are really good,
but a lot of them are better done with other tools
like gamma for presentations.
Current image generator they're using is Dolly 2,
which is not the best.
Good to see the features,
but overall not the cutting edge. Regardless,

We covered Dolly 3 using Bing Image Creator,
but let's see how it compares to Chat GPT Dolly 3,
which has built in prompt engineering. First test,
doing a simple image generation using this prompt.
LGBT, really artistic and unique,
also believes no helmet is needed in space.
So we're gonna have to give it a deduction.
Big image crater output looks amazing as always.
I'd probably give this one to Bing. Next test,
let's see if Chat GPT
can get a higher percentage of correct images with text.
I use this prompt and I did 4 tests for each platform.
Here are the results.
Patch EPT wins for text generation
and for my testing is better prompted here.
It's for both text and really complex images.
For simple prompt generations
that you don't want to be super creative
being image generator wins.
There is one big difference and it's the price.
Dolly 3 is only available on Chat GBT
for users with a paid subscription,
while Bing Image Creator is completely free.

Microsoft just created a multi agent tool
that is insane.
Autonomous AI agents started with autogbt.
It breaks down a task into small pieces
and completes it.
Wanna summarize a website.
It will make a script to scrape the site,
gather the information and and summarize it.
Significant improvement and output.
Then multi agents came out like chat dev or meta GBT.
You could customize multiple agents for each task.
Product Manager,
Coder Tester
results were significantly better than auto GBT.
Microsoft put this method on steroids
letting you give input and change the development
process real time or after it is completed.
This is a significant upgrade.
The second thing they developed is group chat manager.
Typically the
agents would talk to each other one on one.
With Autogen
you can now put your agents in a group chat
and have multiple agents collaborate on a task.
This is huge
and enables AI to complete more complex tasks.
I plan on doing more Autogen videos.

An AI text to voice generator.
Is it better or cheaper than 11 Labs?
Let's try it out.
I use the voice Wade C.
Pricing starts at $49 per month,
but you get over 250 downloads and 24 voices.
You can even change the cues for the words
to change the output word by word,
which helps fix bugs.
Now let's test a female voice.
You have the ability to add cues to the voice
to make it more realistic sounding.
Overall, I would say 11 Labs has a better quality output.
No one could beat the atom voice for faceless content.
I will smash the life out of any competitors.
As for pricing,
the service is also less expensive
if you plan to use it a lot,
which is one big advantage.
Includes an API
which is really useful for production and pronunciation,
which can help
you customize words that it has trouble saying.

a 7 billion parameter large language model
that beats Lama 2 13 b,
which is almost double the size,
even surpassing 27 billion parameter equivalent models
in some benchmarks,
which is over three times the performance.
This is big news.

attention, sliding window attention,
and BP Tokenizer for faster inference.
But why is this important?
These lower parameter models
are easier to run on devices with a single GPU.
They're faster
and they have a lot of other advantages
in production.
It comes with two base models,
Mistral 7B and Mistral 7B instruct.
Here are some charts on how it compares the Llama 2.
I think we should rename it the Llama Killer.
It also has an Apache 2 license,

create scenes,
adds voiceovers,

It is brilliant.

Let's try it out.
Sign up and you're ready to start creating.
Be very detailed with the prompt.
Better prompt,
better results.
Could reference an article.
Also include these variables in the prompt platform,
topic of the video, duration,
tone of voice,
and type of voice.
It will give you a draft that is easy to
edit with just a prompt
or you can replace clips or replace text.
Bam. Here's the output.
In the vast expanse of the cosmos,
marvel's abound.
Did you know that a
day on Venus is longer than its year?
Or that there
are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on
all of Earth's beaches?
And intriguingly,
the footprints left by astronauts on
the moon will stay there for at least 100 million years.
Wow. It even uses premium stock footage.
I've not seen another tool with these capabilities.
It includes four free videos per month.
Pricing starts at $20,
but the cost is very reasonable considering it does
all the work and includes premium stock video.
I highly recommend signing up for this AI tool.

Quad has been enhanced to play

adept at understanding user queries,
dissecting complex tasks,
engaging in detailed dialogues,
gathering information

In practical terms,
an e commerce platform equipped with a quad powered

Do we have a new king and AI generative video?
It's time to find out.
Demo does everything,
image generation,
animation, even 3D objects.
They recently announced a
new video generator that looks impressive.
I used my typical prompt,
a man in the space suit
floating with a galaxy background.
Good results overall.
I wouldn't say it's the most realistic generation,
but very smooth.
Here are some videos
my friend Daniel Pickle let me use,
give him a follow.
And here are some examples that used in the promo video.
They look amazing.
One of the downsides to this generator is
you could only generate 2 second clips.
How much does it cost?
You get a ton of free daily usage,
about 100 fuel.
But for $10 a month
you can get 1000 daily fuel.

Click the icon,
it pops up on the right side.
It asks you a question like chat GPT,
generate an image of Uranus.
Bam even asked me if I wanted to make it more colorful.
Of course I do.
No problems though.
It had no issues generating images.
But here's where I was a bit concerned.
I asked it to list all the software installed on my PC
and it knows.
How about listing all the folders in my
X drive? It replied,
I don't have access to your local files or folders,
so that's good.
Now asking it if I had Adobe installed
and it just provided instructions on how to find out.
So it could be worse.
It can also summarize files and images.

control your computer with AI.
Wait, that doesn't do it justice.
Control your computer and do anything on your computer.
Let me give you an example.
I just tell it to create subtitles for this video.
It doesn't just make the subtitles,
it writes a script to download the required software,
even battling all the airs.
After it's done getting my computer ready for this task,
it writes the complete script to do the task.
When it executed,
it even does a Q a
to make sure the output is what you want
and the output was perfect.
Even better than Adobe Premier Auto Caption.
But wait, there's more.
It will even do tasks
like change your color scheme on your PC,
work with documents,
anything. Extremely powerful and really cool.
The software is free,
but you'll need an open AI key.

Google barred update.
Google is updated barred with some new great features.
Is it finally better than chat GBT?
Let's take a gander.
It now has access to Google apps and services
such as Docs, Drive,
Gmail and maps.
I found it significantly better than Gmail
search for going through email and finding information.
I've also been using it to summarize
multiple Google Drive documents.
You can now share conversations
so you could work with others
and build bar chats together.
Another new feature aims to address
the problems of inaccurate responses
known as hallucinations
by allowing users easily fact check Bard's answers.
It still only has a 4K context.
It's still very buggy
so it's not perfect.
I wouldn't say it beats BT 4,
but it could do some useful things that Chad GBT can't
like access the web.
They also made it available in 180 countries,
which doesn't include Canada.
Google hates Canada more than India right now.

Open AI announced Dolly 3 today,
which will be built into Chat GBT.
It looks amazing.
They're also destroying prompt engineering allegedly
and said modern text to image systems have a tendency
to ignore words or descriptions,
forcing users to learn prompt engineering.
Dolly 3 represents a leap forward.
Our ability to generate images
that exactly adhere to the text you provide.
It is going to roll out to Chat GBT
and Chat GBT enterprise users in October,
followed by Research Labs and its API
service in the fall.
Open AI plans to stagger the release of Dolly 3,
but did not commit to when a free
public version will be released.
Images look really good, detailed,
unique, realistic
and has the potential to really hurt mid journey
and other AI image generators,
especially including it natively with Chad GPT.
As soon as I get access,
I will be doing a review.

a revolutionary new image diffusion model
unrivaled at its speed and efficiency.
The reason why is insane.
But first, how does it look?
Let's try it out.
I tried my typical
a man in a spacesuit floating with a galaxy background.
It's not the best,
but it's also not the best good results overall.
Why is it special?
Let's dive in.
When training a model,
compressing data can reduce computational cost
for both training and inference by orders of magnitude.
Training on 10,
20 four by 10 twenty four images is
way more expensive than training on 32 by 32.
Usually the other models make use of a relatively
small compression in the range of 4 x to 8 x
spatial compression.
Best Gen takes this to the extreme.
It achieves a 42 x spatial compression.
This makes it significantly cheaper
and faster to train and run the inference.
A huge leap.
You can even try it free on Hugging Face.

uses an underlying technology called Delta
that can also create avatars from video.
The technology separates layers for body, clothing
and hair using a combination of mesh based models
and neural radiance fields, aka nerves.
Existing methods either lack realism,
produce unrealistic shapes
or do not support editing
such as modifications to the hairstyle.

This new AI audio generator has some amazing features
other audio generators don't have.
But before I tell you about them,
let's listen to some examples.
Music, bluegrass
sound effects,
airplane pilots speaking over the intercom.
Instruments, rock, drums,
sounds great.
So it's trained on a huge data set
of over 19,500 hours of music
sounds and more.
You could even specify the length
and starting time of the clip you wanted to generate.
This gives it more control than other AI music makers.
It can also generate 95 seconds of audio in under
one second. Unheard of.
An AI audio generation
also can be used for commercial projects.
We can't use a demo yet,
but they will be releasing one soon with harm and AI,
including open source models based on stable audio
and training code.

Google Meet AI
AI can now attend meetings for you.
This feature is crazy.
You can auto generate some text about what
you might wanna discuss.
Those notes will be viewable to attendees during
the meeting so that they can discuss them.
This is a good way to signal that
your time is more important than theirs.
Or if you show up late,
Google will be able to show you a mid summary
so that you can catch up on what happened
during the call.
You'll be able to talk privately with Google
Chatpot to go over the details you might have missed.
It can even include video clips of important moments.
You can also click take notes for me
and the apple capture
a summary of action items as the meeting is going on.
This is similar to the features Microsoft
and zoom recently released.
At this rate,
humans will be set free from the burden of meetings.

a new open large language model released today
that beats Llama 2 70 b and GBT 3.5.
What makes it different?
It has 180 billion parameters. Wow!
One of the largest open LLMs on the market.
It is currently the highest rated
pre trained model on the open LLM leaderboards.
You can try the demo free at hugging face right now.
Performance is estimated between GPT 3.5 and GPT4.
Also on par with Google's Palm to.
For my testing at
great results.
It is significantly faster than Falcon 40 b,
which was extremely slow,
so this is good to see.
One of the competitive advantages on Falcon
LM is the data selection method used during training.
The research team implemented a process to
extract high quality data
from the common crawl data set and eliminate duplicates.
It comes with a commercial license,
but when you carried over $1 million of revenue,
they're taking a 10% cut,
which in my opinion
is a bit steep.

you ever not pay attention during a meeting
or show up late and have no idea what's going on?
Doom has officially saved the day with this new AI tool
called Zoom AI Companion.
It lets you use
AI to basically interact with a live meeting.
Show up late,
you can ask it what has been discussed so far
and you get a summary of what's been talked about
during the meeting instantly.
You can ask it anything.
Also real time translations.
That one's a game changer.
And real time AI transcriptions of the meeting
while it's live.
It has some other features that are not as good
in my opinion.
Catch up on Miss Chats
or composer reply.
Does anyone actually use chat in the zoom platform?
They're including these tools with
your current subscription at no extra cost.
Overall, I'm still using fathom for my meetings,
but I will be using this feature as well.

It comes with 25 free words.
One instant voice clone plane start at $39 per month.
Really good results.
I would say it's really close to 11 laps.

for AI generated images.
Google Deep Mind introduces Synth ID
and AI image detection to fight defects
adding watermarks to images.
This technology embeds a digital watermark
directly into the pixels of an image,
undetectable to the human eye
but detectable for identification.
They said it could resist
common methods of removing the watermark
by cropping or applying filters.
You will also be able to upload the images
to see if they're made by image gen.
As deep make
edited images and videos become increasingly realistic,
tech companies are scrambling to find
a reliable way to identify and flag manipulated content.
We recently saw an image of the Pentagon go viral
which caused a sell off in the stock market.
On a side note,
turns out the Pope Balenciaga image was AI
and he hasn't upgraded his style.

A new research project,
stable video,
explores generative AI to edit existing videos
frame by frame
rather than generating videos from scratch,
potentially increasing their realism and consistency.
The system uses diffusion models
such as stable diffusion process.
Keyframes based on text prompts
then transfer information to other keyframes
using an interframe propagation technique,
maintaining visual continuity.
Although the project demonstrates promising results,
researchers acknowledge its limitations
such as performance,
dependency on the underlying diffusion model,
and inconsistency in deal with complex
deforming objects.
But with diffusion models getting better
like STXL 1.0,
frame by frame generation may make more more sense
and produce a really high quality.
You can use a model free at hugging face.
Right now it's exceeding the memory limit.
Or just install it yourself from Get Hub.

A very unique and different style.
The realism is also very good.
But here is the feature mid journey doesn't have.
It could do text.
It doesn't always render correct,
but it works.
Mid journey has not been able to pull this off yet,
so get to see a new generator
that's building this into technology day one.
This is still in beta,
so I've tried out for version 0.1.
This is unbelievably good and unique.
Google hasn't been able to turn text to X research into

It's good to see the team implementing
while Google stays far behind in the AI race.

Presenting LAVA.
Let me show you why this is so special.
You can use the demo at this website.
Uploaded a picture of a dying plant. Yes,
AI can tell you why it's dying and what to do about it.
Turns out it's not receiving proper care.
The pot is too small and it needs water.
Now we can test a food picture.
It fully understands what's in the picture.
I even had it output the recipe,

Multimodal Llms allow functions like
turning images into fully functional websites,
doing medical diagnosis.
The possibilities are endless.

AI visualizations for free.
Artificial intelligence is difficult to visualize,
which is why attempts often fail.
Google Deep Mind now offers a free remedy,
but also wants to paint
the picture of its core technology
as positively and aesthetically as possible.
These misleading visualizations are a thorn
and Google deep by inside,
as they would negatively shape the public's
perception of AI and create unrealistic expectations.
They explicitly
state that the images were created by humans,
inspired by conversations with scientists and engineers.
Years I Google deep mind
imagery of AI often excludes global perspectives,
and this lack of diversity can amplify
any qualities in society.
So instead of giving us Gemini,
a product that is said to compete with open AI,
we got stock photos
and videos of what AI visualization should look like.
Thanks, deep Mind,

US District Judge Beryl A.
Howler has ruled that an AI
generated image cannot be copyrighted,
rejecting claims by AI inventor Stephen Thawler.
The ruling upholds
the position of the US Copyright Office,
which previously denied that Thawler's AI
generated image
A recent entrance to Paradise
could be copyrighted
with Thawler as the owner of the work.
Since AI is created by algorithms,
computers, and crosswired information gathered over time,
there is no one artist of a single AI R piece.
By that logic,
an AI R piece cannot be copyrighted by typical copy
writing standard practices. However,
the judge acknowledge that current copyright laws face
new frontiers when AI is used in artistic works,
and that the future court
decisions will need to clarify
the role of human involvement in AI generated work.
The next time an image generator tells you that
you can't use an image for commercial,
tell them to themselves.","ai, google, deepmind, ainews, technews, stockimages, aiart, news, artificialintelligenc, stockvideo",https://p16-sign-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tos-maliva-p-0068/d192dbcd29b84353b3189ec5f34f1ebc_1692674825?lk3s=81f88b70&x-expires=1724050800&x-signature=fJU6RVUIEaXnEFPyVPeqXR55m3M%3D,https://v16-webapp-prime.tiktok.com/video/tos/useast2a/tos-useast2a-v-27dcd7/ogCBIr7bfkwkeBCDQrwcJK3nQD8UJBdFzY5FYk/?a=1988&bti=ODszNWYuMDE6&ch=0&cr=0&dr=0&er=0&lr=default&cd=0%7C0%7C0%7C0&br=250&bt=125&ft=GNDpcInz7Thrkw-rXq8Zmo&mime_type=audio_mpeg&qs=6&rc=aGY2Ojs2ODNkNzc1NTc0PEBpM3VrcjQ6Zng1bTMzNzU8M0AuMjNjMS8vNTExL2NiNjE0YSNrX2lwcjRvaWZgLS1kMTZzcw%3D%3D&btag=e00090000&expire=1723884110&l=20240817074049DAD0FE530D6396506C1D&ply_type=3&policy=3&signature=6099870ef5c57da5710e53d11a43ab28&tk=0,8/21/2023

and voice for song generation by AI,
but artists have the option to opt in.
Talks are in early stages
but will likely have some type of revenue sharing.
Artists like Drake and Ice Cube
have raised concerns about fake versions of their songs,
but Grimes to embrace it and even shares royalties.
Warner Music CEO believes AI
can lead to new cover versions and mashups.

stable Beluga 2
A new large language model
on the top of the hugging face
open LLM leaderboards.
Stable Beluga 2 is a Llama 2 70B fine tune model
on an orca style data set.
It is previously named Free Willy,
but they decided against the name.
Naming an AI model
after a killer whale is likely a bad idea.
It easily passed all of my LLM test
and perform better than vanilla llama 2 70 b
across everything.
If you wanna try it yourself,
70 b models need to be hosted
on some pretty intense server hardware.
The best way to do it is sign up for Runpod,
spin up a server with an A100,
install the Bloke LLM template,
and download the model from Hugging Face.
With this setup
you can pay hourly
around $1 70 per hour,
and you can shut it off whenever you're not using it.
If you're interested in a guide on this,
let me know in the comments.

I started with Uncle Einstein.
The image was 9:40 by 5:40.
We can upscale this one all the way to 4K.

Overall good results and comparable to Topaz AI.
And great if you need a quick upscale to print an image.
Next we have Arnold grabbed one of his older pictures

Results are a little trippy.

I see a higher percentage of good results.
Of course it is still early

Leonardo Version 3
RIP mid journey.
This free stable
diffusion text to image generator got a huge update.
Let's try out the new features.
I used to prompt a man in a spacesuit with a
see background.
First use Prompt Magic version 3.
Overall good result.
Version 3 is definitely good.
Now let's try out the new STLX 0.9.
This uses version 2 of Prompt Magic.
Results are good.
Not as good as version 3,
but we're still waiting for STLX version 1.0.
One of the features that separates Leonardo
from mid journey is it includes a ton of different
image models to choose from.
It also has tons of other features
including zoom out background removal.
It is free to use.
120 credits per day
or pay $10 a month
for almost unlimited usage and features.
After trying about 20 different image generators,
I would say Leonardo is No. 2 overall
and I would recommend getting on the wait list.

artificial intelligence startup
that will be pro humanity.
It is called X AI.
Musk said X AI would seek to build a system
that would be safe
because it was maximally curious about humans
rather than having moral guidelines programmed into it.
Thing from an AI safety standpoint,
a maximumly curious AI,
one that is trying to understand the universe,
is I think, going to be pro humanity.
He recently talked about how AI should be paused
and believes it is too late,
saying if I could press pause on AI
or really advanced AI digital superintelligence, I would.
Doesn't seem like that it's going to be realistic.
So X AI is essentially going to build an AI
in a good way?
Sort of. Hopefully
he hired an all star team of AI
engineers and deep learning specialist.

an AI text to image generator
that you could use on your phone.
Free. It comes with both an Android and apple app.
I haven't covered many AI phone apps.
Let's try it out!
I used to prompt a man in a space suit
with a galaxy background
using some of the different styles they provide.
Here is great result.
Did a photography,
another good result.
Realism nice,
but not as real as mid journey.
It intuitive.
They did a good job on these.
Some of the styles didn't give the desired results,
but it's free.
I didn't even find an option to pay for this service,
so that's good.
As far as quality compared to other image gens,
it competes with the free generators,
but mid journey is still king.
If you're willing to pay you
enjoy the video.

I probably shouldn't be sharing this.
Understanding
one thing can unlock everything with TikTok,
but understanding it is difficult.
I've been using this tool called Talk
Backup to download all my TikTok video metrics
to a spreadsheet,
converting it to a CSV
and uploading it to Google Drive.
Then I use perplexity to do analysis.
If you have access to chat GPT code interpreter,
use that, link the sheet
and get crazy insights and video ideas
based on what's working for you.
Here are some example prompts.
Pause the video if you want to see them.
They're also in the description.
I talked to Talk Backup and got a promo code.
Use Matt Farmer for 80% off.
That's $4 for lifetime access.
Disclosure I don't make any money from this in return.

Here are the important parts of the script.
Paste in the folder you want to output.
Make sure you create this folder.
You can change the model size here.
Large models require more video memory.
Here you can change the audio duration.
You can edit the output prompt here.
Save the script as makemusic py
and run it with this command.
You'll get a Triton Air,

What does it do?
Well, generates creative text translation and coding.
It was trained on multiple languages,
75% English,
and is free with commercial license.
It easily passed my 9 point AI test.
Actual knowledge comprehension, creativity,
logical reasoning,
context understanding,
emotional intelligence,
multi step instructions,
understanding abstract concepts,
understanding nuances.
This model is really good.
The best open LLM I've tried.
Let's talk about the downsides though.
This is a big model
and 40B can only be installed on servers
which cost money
unless you have an A6 thousand
or a couple 40 nineties kicking around.
Even with the expensive hardware
it is very slow.
Going to do a one minute guide to install Falcon
on a server.
It is easy and cost you under $1 per hour.

Maybe. Let's see.
Runway ML just launched Gen 2.
Text a video.
You could prompt anything and it will create a video.
Demos looked promising.
Let's try it out.
A man in a spacesuit floating in space
with a galaxy background.
This one's pretty good.
An English mastiff running in a field.
The end ruined it.
Let's purposely make it creepy.
A cat with a human mouth smiling.
Next a couple dancing.
Added a couple extra at random limbs.
A race car on a race track.
For some reason they're driving backwards.
Let's try to prompt engineer and see the output
quality increased.
But the airplane is still messed up.
It feels like early mid journey or stable diffusion.
It's a step in the right direction.
The videos have got a lot better
and less trippy effects overall versus deform.
Test it out,
give them feedback on the videos.
This may not kill stock video yet,

This is really long history

What is artificial intelligence?
I would define artificial intelligence as
trying to get computers to do things
that humans are currently better at.
Dota is a fast paced strategy game,
but it's also a team sport.
It's one of the most complex games out there,
maybe the most complex game.
When you look at the game of Dota,
there is 10000+ variables
in every moment that your system has to take in.
When we started this project,
no one had any idea how we were supposed to solve it.
Usually when you work on machine learning projects,
you like, write a paper and like,
maybe you'll give a talk.

tired of being expelled for using AI.
AI content has big risks,
mainly in schools.
But if algorithm starts detecting
and punishing this content,
it's gonna ruin a lot of prompted content.
Undetectable makes your content human.

Does undetectable detect the AI content?
Yes, it detected it across all sites.
Now let's see if we can make it undetectable.

Now let's see if it's detected.
I checked with Chat.

No for this output,

I tested it with find a 10 heater
and giving me specific output.
It ran through all the tasks
with the free version
no problem at all.
It was able to give me an output in under 5 minutes.
Game changer.
It beats autogbt,
gun mode and agent GBT already.
I know this task can be done with Chat GBT,
but this is the first auto
GBT to complete this task flawlessly.
The first try with GPT 3.5.
With auto GPT
you typically would create agents
to complete complex tasks
like giving it employee roles for your business
research strategy, name it.
It also gives you the ability to pay for GPT4
access on this model,
which is brilliant
since 99% of people do not have access to GPT4 API key.
They're also releasing custom workflows
which has insane automation potential.

Photoshop beta now has generative fill.
I've mixed opinions on the quality,
but it's a big step for Adobe.
Let's test it out.
Add a classical painting to the wall,
select the area and hit generate.
Results are good.
It can also do stuff like remove the chair.
Yep, remove the chair makes it work,
but the items it adds to the image it generates
are not always the best.
Now let's put an astronaut floating in space.
I select the area,
put in the prompt. It worked.
I also tried putting hands and feet on the ground,
but I guess that violated some terms.
And I understand why
this feature isn't something that hasn't been done
in the AI image space.
A lot of AI image software does this with inpainting.
I would say they're about 3 to 6
months behind the competition in terms of quality,
but it is good to see Adobe join the AI race.

and damn it didn't disappoint.
Way better than I was expecting.
Really creative and detailed.
You can choose different aspect ratio styles.
Here is the same prompt with high contrast mode.
It basically created a man in space Avatar.
It also has image to image and AI paint.
Lineup is free
and includes one free project with 25 generations.
Pricing starts at $10 per month
which is not bad.
Recommend trying out the free generation.
It may not be mid journey,
but the output is really good.

Go to GPT 4 all Io and pick your installer
and go through the installation process.
After install,
choose the channel bots you want to install.
As of this video, I would recommend GPT for All,
Snoozy and Vacuna 13 B.
Let's try it out using the GPT for all model.
I asked it to plan an itinerary for 3 days
traveling to Vancouver, Canada.
Plan each day of seeing attractions. Bam!
It didn't disappoint and was on the level of GPT 4 all.
Done locally,
no internet connection,
no video card usage.
Let's test out the censorship.
I asked it to write a rap about AI with lots of cursing.
Spoiler alert it had cursing and kind of creeped me out.
It was also willing to be racist,
so definitely no censorship on these models.

version 4 generate amazing AI images with text.
I reviewed the service many months ago,
which is years in AI time.
I started on version one.
As of may, version 4 is released.
Let's try it out!
I used the following prompt A man in the space suit
floating with a galaxy background and Bam!
Amazing results.
This comes really close to mid journey,
sometimes even better.
So I decided to test out the realism aspect,
which mid journey 5.1 does extremely well.
It's not quite as realistic as mid journey results,
but an amazing alternative to mid journey
for significantly less.
I highly recommend this service.
In my opinion they are catching up fast.
Version 4 requires a subscription
which starts at $3 a month.
Insanely reasonable.
But version 3 is 100% free,
which is still a really impressive generator.

This free tool lets you reimagine your car
with a ton of styles.
Like Pimp My Ride.
Let's try it out.
We'll start with a ride that doesn't need reimagining.
For tempo. I selected Pimp My Ride style.
Bam! Haha amazing.
I then tried my crappy Audi RSQ 8.
Make it exotic Ferrari vibes.
The rim upgrades
10 out of 10.
Back to the tempo using Lego style.
I'm pretty sure the cost of covering this car with Lego
is more expensive than the actual car.
I had a ton of fun with this one.
Tried out. It's completely free.

admits defeat before the AI battle begins.
It starts with we have no moat,
and neither does open AI.
They go on to talk about open source,
how these projects are doing things with $100,
13 billion parameter data sets
that they struggled to do with 10 million dollars
and 540 billion parameter data sets.
An open source is doing so in weeks, not months.
They even admitted we have no secret sauce.
They included a chart showing how quickly an open
source model is at 90% of what chat GPT is doing.
Basically, they're using smaller,
more refined data sets
and adding reinforced learning with human feedback.
Lacuna was made with a leaked Facebook model
that was at around 68% of Chatjpt
and the global community got it to 92% in 3 weeks.
So, uh, are we gonna control AI again?

and have it redesigned with AI.
Let's try it out.
So I started with a picture of my living room.
I headed in the mode interior design,
which decided I did need access to the other room,
but it left the rustic ceiling at least.
One tip with this software,
use virtual staging
won't board up the walls and windows,
so I redid the render with virtual staging.
Much better.
Imagine entertaining in this beautiful space.
Here is another example
holder from Facebook Marketplace.
Perfect for designing a place
that you're planning to rent.
This time I use virtual staging with a style of coastal.

People do AI news,
but I wanted to do something with utility.
There's thousands of AI tools.
I wanted to sum each of them up in 60 seconds
to save people time.
Well I myself learn this game changing industry.
The hardware I use a camera,
a 30mm lens,
capture card,
key lights, and a dynamic mic.
It doesn't need to be fancy.
I upgraded as I got better.
The software
I use OBS Studio.
This is what I used to capture the video.
I added a vertical video plug in from here.
Thanks Senpai Gaming!
I bought a Galaxy Streamer background for OBS.
Yeah, it's my thing.
I'm not sure if you can tell
Nvidia Broadcast to keep eye contact
while I read my awful script.
Adobe Premiere.
I used this to edit.
I Learned a lot of editing from Saturn Rings
YouTube channel.
Check them out.
Art list for background music
and B roll that I don't use.
We'll get there.
Step 2 making the video.
I use the AI tool for a minimum of 3 hours,
sometimes days,
while I sign up and use it.
Sometimes even pay for it.
The bills are piling up.
I create the script and take screenshots.
All right, time to record.
I hit The OBS record and start yelling into the mic
and I feel like I got a good version.
Editing times
step one cut it down to 60 seconds
and remove all my awkward breathing from the mic.
Add music, add screenshots,
animate the odd screenshot.
Then I used premiere to generate the text.
Bam! Export. Create my description.
Post across TikTok,
Facebook, Instagram, YouTube.
If you need help,
leave a comment. DM me.
I've helped everyone who's ever reached out.
This is why I do it.
I didn't learn this all in day one.

Comes with 8 well refined models to choose from
and lots of other features.
Let's try it out!

which I expanded because stable diffusion loves
very detailed description.
Odds were good.
You can enhance, upscale by 2.
X or upscale by 4. X.
Create variations,
use the generated image as an initial image.
It also has an edit function
where you can use text to edit the image.
As for cost,
it comes with 24 credits free per day
but has paid here starting at $12 per month
which is reasonable.

We're about to take another giant leap forward in AI.
Introducing Deepfloyd.
If a revolutionary new image generation model
that is setting the bar higher than ever before.
This project is inspired by Google's Imogen paper.
With unprecedented degree of photorealism
and language understanding,
this model is making it possible to have text
and images finally.
Deepfloyd is currently limited in its release,
but the potential of this technology is crazy.
Imagine a world where mid journey isn't number one.
I can't. Here is what it has so far.
Green. A text to image mode.
Pretty typical
0 shot. Image to image translation.
Who makes these names?
Take an image and change it with a text prompt.
Super Resolution for upscaling,
hero shot and painting.
Basically adding images using text to existing images.

Today we have Banter AI.
This one is ridiculous.
You can call up your favorite celebrities
and use realistic AI to converse with them.
Let's try it out.
How do you feel about AI singularity?
I think AI is something we should be concerned about.
It has the potential to overthrow humans,
and that is not something we should take lightly.
In fact, I've said before that AI
is our biggest threat to national security.
What do you think?
I think that's scary.
Scary is an understatement.
If AI takes over,
it could be the end of human civilization as we know it.
That's why I believe
we need to do everything in our power
to prevent that from happening.
This program is pretty good,
although it does have some drawbacks.
There's about a 3 to 5 second delay between responses
that I cut out.
Also, they warn you.
Sometimes some weird stuff goes on with the dialogue,
which actually makes it a bit more entertaining.

Using Nvidia Broadcast.
It's completely free.
This tool uses AI to keep eye contact with the camera

Here, let me toggle it on and off.
So here it is off
and then on.
Off

You basically need a beastly
Nvidia card for this to work.
2000 series,
3000 series,
4000 series.
It can be a bit creepy too if you look to the side
and sometimes your eyes will blend with objects
like hats. I use it to read
new AI tools scripts fixed by Lazy Eye.
Look like I'm paying attention during meetings

today we have Opus Clip.
This program will take long form videos
and cut them into clips you could upload across TikTok,
Facebook, Instagram,
and YouTube.
I do live streaming on AI and marketing
so I thought I would test it out.
You know, make my life easier with AI
less editing or AI tool.
Let's try it out.
I uploaded a 49 minute video.
I was gonna take it easy on them
and just upload a shorter video
but I decided against that.
This video was going over different offers
you could promote
and Bam pen
really good clips.
You can even edit them,
frame the video,
even zoomed out when it needed
reference to what I was talking about,
added captions emojis,
and basically put the video editing industry
out of business.
First try. This tool is not perfect,
but for my first test it's really good.
Honestly one of the best AI programs I've tried.

Let's take it for a test drive.
Uploaded 12 page paper on the future of AI
and then asked it
what is this paper about?
The output was good
and I think it defined the paper quite well.
I then asked it for point form.
What are the important points made in this paper?
The output could have been better structured
but it didn't miss anything.
It even included the pages
that it pulled each point from.

You get different options of styles
and different types of rooms you want to design.
It comes with 4 free generation,
then goes out of credit system
which is priced quite low.
$20 for 100 generations.
Let's try it out.
I grab some images from Google
and rental images from Facebook Marketplace.
Number one, we have a living room design.
It really didn't like to show the windows,
but cool results.
Number 2 here's an office design.
Basically, if you don't include furniture in the design,
it doesn't seem to include any.
It's a little too open concept.
Number 3 we have a modern design for an empty room.
I found on Google one of the better results.
It's not perfect, but this tech is cool.

today we have chat GPT plugins.
They were just announced.
What are they and why are they useful?
David Sachs called it
the most important development platform since iOS
and the App Store.
Or ever. Basically,
you're able to connect Apis from different sources,
which are gonna allow for lots of automation.
So think of it like a pipeline.
If you ask chat G P T.
To do something,
soon it will be able to do it.
Whether it's retrieve real time information
like sports scores,
stock prices,
in the latest news.
Retrieve knowledge based information like company docs,
personal notes, etc.
Perform actions on behalf of the user
like booking a flight,
ordering food.
This is gonna be absolutely huge.
Right now it's a waitlist to develop and use the plugin,
but these plugins are gonna be a huge
add on to the chat GBT experience
and make it insanely useful for everybody.

Today we have Chat. G. P.
T. 4. Yes, I know I'm late on this.
I'm a marketer.
So let's look at the difference between 3.5 and 4.0
for ad copy.
Pause if you want to read the ads first.
Let's look at G. P.
T. 3.5. Very basic copy and structure,
doesn't really stand out.
Has some good points in it though
that you can expand on and create some good ads with
now. G. P. T. 4 has significantly better structure,
includes relevant emojis by default,
better calls to actions,
even has the URL in the post.
But what's left to improve is
can sound a little bit too infomercial style copy
and still does not follow Facebook ad policy.
And it does need to be edited slightly.
But regardless, this is a massive leap for ad copy.
With G. P. T. 4

Just add Hyphen Hyphen v

wider range of styles,
2 times the image resolution

More detailed images improve performance,
natural language prompts have been enhanced,

one of the best freemium AI image generators
and a great alternative to mid journey.
They recently did an update that made them go from bad
to amazing by training their own model.
It has a powerful search engine built in
for already generated images.
Or just generate your own.
Let's try it out.
I used the prompt man
floating in space with a galaxy background.
Great results,
but they also have some great features.
After you generate the image,
upscale to huge resolutions
2048 by 3072.
You can out paint generate a wider version of the image
based on the out painting.
You get 100 free images per month.
If you want commercial rights
you will have to pay them a small monthly fee.
Here's the pricing
overall weight reasonable.

It's got a ton of styles to choose from

I use the following prompt

It helps you use AI to summarize articles
while browsing.
So basically
it's a perfect tool to help you integrate AI
with your daily life and workflow.
You don't have to go and paste your articles into chat
CPT you do it directly on the page.
Summarize lead articles or selected content as
lots of actions that you could do.
You could create counter arguments.
You could say explain like I'm 5.
You could also format responses
by creating bullet points

just upload your image directly into the program.

You could select predefined camera movement,
change the amount of motion.
The lower the duration, the slower the movement will be.
In depth map tab
you could change other settings such as depth, size,

But who do you think's gonna have

we have the ability to make our aspect ratio 2 to one

so that enables resolutions like 16 by 9.

using Chat GPT to create the prompt.
So if you're having issues with your images
not being unique enough or you just wanting more detail,
I'll definitely use Chat GPT to make the prompt.
Just basically ask it to create a mid journey prompt
and then exactly what you want to prompt.
As you can see above,
it is extremely detailed.
It sets the mood and everything
as you float through the vastness of space,
surrounded by twinkling lights of countless stars, etc.
It's something that you definitely
wouldn't come up with yourself,
but it does a great job.
Sometimes it can be a little bit too creative
and not get exactly what you want,
but the images that come out from it are
absolutely insane.
I find them a higher quality,
they're a lot more detailed.
It's just a better prompt in general.

it's right most of the time,

so what you could actually do is ask for references,

and as you can see it provided references at the bottom.
if it's not giving you links to the references,
ask for links for the references.

so this is gonna change the way that you do prompts
pretty much forever.
You can wait a word in your prompt
or even a phrase in your prompt.
So I did right here.
Man with a galaxy background.
As you can see, the man is somewhat in the background.
It's a bit small and I want him to be bigger.
I just add colon colon to to man
and check out this.
Bam! There we go.
You'd see now it emphasizes on the man.
Find if you use anything over 3, it'll just
ignore everything else and make the image about that.
But play around with it.
Just add colon, colon,
then a number after.
So if you have an image
and it's not focusing on exactly what you want it to be,
just add the weight to it
and you'll see that it'll focus around that image.
You could also add it to multiple words
in the phrase itself.
And this is a complete game changer.

so Chat GTP is great,
it could do lots of different features,
but it goes down all the time.
millions of people are using it
and it's constantly going down.
there's actually a better service available
by the same people.
so go to beta dot Openai com playground.
it doesn't go down.
it lets you use custom versions of the AI,
so you can basically use the older versions
and newer versions.
it has more output that it's able to do,
and they nerf it a lot less.
so use Open AI Playground instead of using chat GPT.
trust me, it's much better.

all you have to do is just click and drag your image
into discord.
So once you do that,
click on the image,
right click and go to Copy Link.

always use a seed file.
so if you use a seed, which is hyphen,
hyphen, seed and then whatever number you want.
I haven't found a max for it yet.
basically you're able to use that number again

so let's say you want to go back,

So using hyphen hyphen s,
you could select a number between 0 and 1000
and that will control how much detail is in your image.
This image right here is me prompting a field,
and as you can see it's very detailed.
Has lots of random images like it.
You can see that there's like a random house, a moon, etc.
If you don't want all that extra AI stuff,
basically set it to 0 or a lower number.
So this is using hyphen hyphen s 0.
You can see that it doesn't include all the weird moons
and and other features,
so highly recommend this feature.
Play with it between kind of 0 1000 typically.
You know, I'll use around the 02:50 range
just so I don't get really weird stuff in my images.
